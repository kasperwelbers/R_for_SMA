Here are the best ideas to celebrate at home or in public. What Is King Charles’s Coronation? A coronation is the ceremony of the formal investiture of a monarch with their regal powers. It is a symbolic ceremony combining a religious service and pageantry. Coronations are grand events in which the monarch is given royal ceremonial objects, such as the crown. This will be physically placed on the sovereign’s head, in front of many thousands of guests. King Charles coronation is taking place at Westminster Abbey on 6th May. The King, who will be crowned with the St. Edward Crown, will be the 40th reigning monarch crowned there since 1066.
