coronation, King Charles carries on a medieval tradition","description":"Great Britain‚Äôs royal family turns the page on a new chapter with the coronation of King Charles III. Charles ascended the throne when his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, died last year. But the coronation Saturday is a religious ceremony that provides a more formal confirmation of his role as head of state and titular head of the Church of England. The pomp, pageantry and symbolism of the occasion date back to the medieval times when English kings wielded great power. Charles says he wants to slim down the monarchy, and his coronation was planned accordingly. But it still will feature ornate regalia and be attended by heads of state and royals from other nations.","unwound_url":"https://apnews.com/article/coronation-king-charles-queen-elizabeth-57485899e7a3ad8df0909f8e58599f75"}],"mentions":[{"start":55,"end":58,"username":"AP","id":"51241574"}],"annotations":[{"start":19,"end":34,"probability":0.9005,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"King Charles III"}],"hashtags":{},"cashtags":{}},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":5},"lang":"en","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1653766176143491075"],"created_at":"2023-05-03T14:19:16.000Z","conversation_id":"1653766176143491075","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"author_id":"985996864809062401","possibly_sensitive":true,"text":"What to know about King Charles III‚Äôs coronation (from @AP) https://t.co/VAzuaEIfAQ","id":"1653766176143491075","referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{"coordinates":{"coordinates":{}}}},{"entities":{"urls":{},"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":15,"username":"MatthewOToole2","id":"403412822"}],"annotations":[{"start":202,"end":206,"probability":0.9346,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Biden"}],"hashtags":{},"cashtags":{}},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":40},"lang":"en","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1653766170548240385"],"created_at":"2023-05-03T14:19:15.000Z","conversation_id":"1653706391465472001","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"author_id":"1626020366","possibly_sensitive":false,"text":"@MatthewOToole2 We all know why you‚Äôre against the coronation , just have the balls to say that you despise  the monarchy and all who celibate it, I bet you didn‚Äôt have a word to say about how much the Biden fly by visit cost üôÑ","id":"1653766170548240385","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1653706391465472001"}],"in_reply_to_user_id":"403412822","geo":{"coordinates":{"coordinates":{}}}},{"entities":{"urls":[{"start":69,"end":92,"url":"https://t.co/5dwLWWa22e","expanded_url":"https://catererlicensee.com/hospitality-set-to-enjoy-1-21bn-boost-from-king-charles-coronation/","display_url":"catererlicensee.com/hospitality-se‚Ä¶","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1653690600313479171/8w2xS6rH?format=jpg&name=orig","width":800,"height":445},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1653690600313479171/8w2xS6rH?format=jpg&name=150x150","width":150,"height":150}],"status":200,"title":"Hospitality Set to Enjoy ¬£1.21bn Boost from King Charles‚Äô Coronation - CLH News: Caterer, Licensee and Hotelier News","description":"The hospitality industry is set to see a boost of ¬£1.21bn over King Charles‚Äô Coronation weekend (6th - 8th May), as consumers enjoy their extra time off in pubs, bars, and restaurants, according to new research.
