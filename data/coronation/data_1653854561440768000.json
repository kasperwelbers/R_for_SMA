I enjoyed slices of this popular British dessert during afternoon tea while visiting London a few years ago. I tried baking this cake when I returned to my American kitchen and it was marvelous. The Victoria Sandwich we enjoyed at The Orangery in Kensington Palace had a raspberry-cream filling. I chose to use lemon curd for my version and it was unforgettable. Enjoy slices of this easy-to-bake cake any day you feel the craving for a superb dessert.","unwound_url":"https://thequirinokitchen.com/how-to-bake-the-british-victoria-sandwich-sponge-cake/"}],"annotations":[{"start":22,"end":38,"probability":0.4306,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"Victoria Sandwich"},{"start":42,"end":52,"probability":0.5299,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"Sponge Cake"},{"start":105,"end":114,"probability":0.6435,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"Coronation"},{"start":141,"end":159,"probability":0.7294,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"The Quirino Kitchen"}],"mentions":{},"hashtags":[{"start":21,"end":30,"tag":"Victoria"},{"start":104,"end":115,"tag":"Coronation"}],"cashtags":{}},"id":"1653857625237254145","created_at":"2023-05-03T20:22:39.000Z","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1653857625237254145"],"referenced_tweets":{},"attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"geo":{}},{"lang":"en","author_id":"1076476016426696704","conversation_id":"1653856036313264129","text":"@crimlawuk Oh do just shut up ‚Ä¶ all you do is moan!! #Coronation","possibly_sensitive":false,"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":12,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":215},"entities":{"urls":{},"annotations":[{"start":54,"end":63,"probability":0.7547,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"Coronation"}],"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":10,"username":"crimlawuk","id":"297065020"}],"hashtags":[{"start":53,"end":64,"tag":"Coronation"}],"cashtags":{}},"id":"1653857620409581568","created_at":"2023-05-03T20:22:38.000Z","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1653857620409581568"],"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1653856036313264129"}],"attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"in_reply_to_user_id":"297065020","geo":{}},{"lang":"en","author_id":"125211600","conversation_id":"1653857618455085062","text":"A royal affair: King Charles III coronation rekindles regal memories https://t.co/dEQ3b2A8go","possibly_sensitive":false,"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":408},"entities":{"urls":[{"start":69,"end":92,"url":"https://t.co/dEQ3b2A8go","expanded_url":"https://ift.tt/lrBXPZj","display_url":"ift.tt/lrBXPZj","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1653857623349895176/6rcpJ2Fi?format=jpg&name=orig","width":1200,"height":630},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1653857623349895176/6rcpJ2Fi?format=jpg&name=150x150","width":150,"height":150}],"status":200,"title":"A royal affair: King Charles III coronation rekindles regal memories","description":"With the coronation of King Charles III just around the corner, Newcastle locals have reflected on their memories...","unwound_url":"https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/8181246/a-royal-affair-king-charles-iii-coronation-rekindles-regal-memories/?src=rss"}],"annotations":[{"start":16,"end":31,"probability":0.8453,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"King Charles III"}],"mentions":{},"hashtags":{},"cashtags":{}},"id":"1653857618455085062","created_at":"2023-05-03T20:22:38.000Z","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1653857618455085062"],"referenced_tweets":{},"attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"geo":{}},{"lang":"en","author_id":"92242395","conversation_id":"1653857602130829316","text":"Now a cherished part of our human history, who doesn‚Äôt remember what they were exactly doing when the Late Queen died, this very moment?
