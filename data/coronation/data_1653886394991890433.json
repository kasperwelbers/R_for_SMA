With or without the check guy. By questioning the concept of movement, I try to develop forms that do not follow logical criteria, but are based only on subjective associations and formal parallels, which incite the viewer to make new personal associations. My works establish a link between the landscape’s reality and that imagined by its conceiver. These works focus on concrete questions that determine our existence. By choosing mainly formal solutions, I find that movement reveals an inherent awkwardness, a humour that echoes our own vulnerabilities. I also consider movement as a metaphor for the ever-seeking man who experiences a continuous loss. My work isolates the movements of humans and/or objects. By doing so, new sequences are created which reveal an inseparable relationship between light, landscape and motion. My major influences include Raoul Dufy, Van Gogh, Richter, Hockney, Turner, Rembrandt and Caravaggio","unwound_url":"https://opensea.io/collection/mostowl"},{"start":134,"end":157,"url":"https://t.co/nBI8VbbG1P","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/MostOwl/status/1653891752548507648/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/nBI8VbbG1P","images":{},"media_key":"3_1653891748740108288"},{"start":134,"end":157,"url":"https://t.co/nBI8VbbG1P","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/MostOwl/status/1653891752548507648/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/nBI8VbbG1P","images":{},"media_key":"3_1653891748731695107"}],"hashtags":[{"start":65,"end":69,"tag":"nft"},{"start":70,"end":74,"tag":"art"},{"start":75,"end":82,"tag":"artist"},{"start":121,"end":126,"tag":"PEPE"},{"start":127,"end":133,"tag":"TURBO"}],"cashtags":{}},"created_at":"2023-05-03T22:38:16.000Z","referenced_tweets":{},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":3,"like_count":5,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":62},"text":"In honour of the coronation.
