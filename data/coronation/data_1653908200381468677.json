III at an Impasse With Church of England Over His Coronation - Wants Participation of Non-Christian Clerics in Defiance of Tradition - Globalist King Previously Accused of Secretly Being a Muslim | The Gateway Pundit | by Paul Serran","description":"With four weeks to go until the ceremony of Coronation of Britain’s King Charles III, the final preparations are still in a flux, as the Globalist Monarch ‘has been at loggerheads with Church of England leaders over the role other faiths should play in his Coronation.’ Daily Mail reports: “Church sources say the monarch has been told that his desire for a ‘diverse’ ceremony, including participation by non-Christians, risks clashing with centuries- old canon law, which bars Muslim, Hindu, Jewish and other faith leaders from reading out prayers during the service.” Charles has long held the desire to be a ‘Defender of all Faiths’, and wants to make a statement about it on his Coronation, but Church leaders resist him, ‘given that it is an Anglican ceremony, as well as a constitutional event’.","unwound_url":"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2023/04/charles-iii-at-an-impasse-with-church-of-england-over-his-coronation-wants-participation-of-non-christian-clerics-in-defiance-of-tradition-globalist-king-previously-accused-of-secretly-being-a-mus/"}],"annotations":[{"start":0,"end":2,"probability":0.69,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"WEF"},{"start":14,"end":20,"probability":0.8449,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Charles"}],"mentions":[{"start":137,"end":150,"username":"Nigel_Farage","id":"19017675"},{"start":151,"end":157,"username":"Adele","id":"184910040"},{"start":160,"end":174,"username":"TuckerCarlson","id":"22703645"},{"start":175,"end":187,"username":"seanhannity","id":"41634520"},{"start":188,"end":199,"username":"Jim_Jordan","id":"18166778"},{"start":200,"end":208,"username":"nytimes","id":"807095"},{"start":209,"end":216,"username":"TheSun","id":"34655603"},{"start":217,"end":221,"username":"CNN","id":"759251"},{"start":222,"end":230,"username":"BBCNews","id":"612473"},{"start":231,"end":244,"username":"rustyrockets","id":"19562228"},{"start":246,"end":255,"username":"guardian","id":"87818409"}],"hashtags":{},"cashtags":{}},"edit_history_tweet_ids":["1653915748010536962"],"lang":"en","conversation_id":"1653915748010536962","possibly_sensitive":false,"author_id":"269580595","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"text":"Their
