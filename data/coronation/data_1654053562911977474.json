Coronations: The Deep History","description":"The roots of the coronation ritual are fabulously ancient: certain elements of the ceremony are vestiges from the later Roman Empire, others have their origins in the Old Testament and ancient Egypt. The liturgy used can be traced back to the 10th century, and the very idea of kings taking part in rituals comes from Charlemagne.  In light of the first British coronation in more than half a century taking place this weekend, Tom and Dominic explore the historical and sacral roots of the coronation ritual. *The Rest Is History Live Tour 2023*: Tom and Dominic are going on an international tour in 2023 and performing in Dublin, Washington D.C. and New York!  Buy your tickets here: restishistorypod.com Twitter:  @TheRestHistory   @holland_tom   @dcsandbrook Hosted on Acast.
