Each item is meticulously prepared entirely by hand using heritage techniques in Staffordshire, England, and is crafted from English fine bone china, hand-painted and decorated with 22 karat burnished gold trims. Bestsellers include the Georgian collection inspired by classic styles typical of the time, as well as Her Majesty The Queen's 90th Commemorative collection to mark the occasion of her 90th birthday. From teacups and saucers to bowls, plates and teapots, each piece is perfectly presented in Royal Collection tissue paper and a handcrafted box to lend a suitably regal finish to home settings.","unwound_url":"https://www.royalcollectionshop.co.uk/jewellery/collaborations/vicki-sarge.html"},{"start":267,"end":290,"url":"https://t.co/2wqIb19iYs","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/VICKISARGE/status/1654063135597142017/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/2wqIb19iYs","images":{},"media_key":"3_1654063070035968000"},{"start":267,"end":290,"url":"https://t.co/2wqIb19iYs","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/VICKISARGE/status/1654063135597142017/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/2wqIb19iYs","images":{},"media_key":"3_1654063070036074496"},{"start":267,"end":290,"url":"https://t.co/2wqIb19iYs","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/VICKISARGE/status/1654063135597142017/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/2wqIb19iYs","images":{},"media_key":"3_1654063070031884289"}],"hashtags":[{"start":131,"end":142,"tag":"vickisarge"},{"start":143,"end":154,"tag":"handmadeuk"},{"start":155,"end":172,"tag":"buckinghampalace"},{"start":173,"end":198,"tag":"handmadecostumejewellery"},{"start":199,"end":205,"tag":"bling"},{"start":206,"end":217,"tag":"coronation"},{"start":218,"end":232,"tag":"CoronationDay"},{"start":233,"end":249,"tag":"coronationparty"},{"start":250,"end":256,"tag":"style"},{"start":257,"end":266,"tag":"beunique"}],"cashtags":{}},"created_at":"2023-05-04T09:59:17.000Z","author_id":"1448458640","referenced_tweets":{},"conversation_id":"1654063135597142017","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":11},"possibly_sensitive":false,"attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1654063070035968000","3_1654063070036074496","3_1654063070031884289"],"poll_ids":{}},"geo":{}},{"text":"@VirginAtlantic you having any sales for the bank holiday/coronation for holidays??","id":"1654063135253315584","lang":"en","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1654063135253315584"],"entities":{"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":15,"username":"VirginAtlantic","id":"20626359"}],"annotations":{},"urls":{},"hashtags":{},"cashtags":{}},"created_at":"2023-05-04T09:59:17.000Z","in_reply_to_user_id":"20626359","author_id":"479562208","referenced_tweets":{},"conversation_id":"1654063135253315584","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":1,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":54},"possibly_sensitive":false,"attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"geo":{}},{"text":"Britain‚Äôs Economy Needs a Pick-Me-Up.
