Among them is easyJet Holidays, which hit a beach on the English Channel in West Sussex for an elaborate sandcastle sculpture of Buckingham Palace. The sculpture was made using a Buckingham Palace sandcastle bucket, commissioned by the airline, which led to the creation of a scale model replica of Charles‚Äô London residence. It measures 3 feet wide by 0.8 feet high by 0.6 feet deep and contains 3-4 kilograms of sand. The project was led by PR agency Taylor Herring, which has something of a history of doing eye-catching beach sculptures. Back in the 2013, the agency created a giant dragon skull and installed it on Charmouth Beach on Dorset‚Äôs Jurassic coast‚Äîclaiming it had washed ashore. (It was a stunt for HBO‚Äôs Game of Thrones.)
