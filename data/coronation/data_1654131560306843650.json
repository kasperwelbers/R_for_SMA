Festivities will follow Sunday and Monday. Coronations are big events in England! The last one was Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation in 1953. When a king or queen dies, the heir to the throne immediately becomes the next queen or king. A coronation is the official grand ceremony where the royal crown is placed on the new monarch (king or queen) and prayers are said for him or her, and the entire nation.

The project was led by PR agency Taylor Herring, which has something of a history of doing eye-catching beach sculptures. Back in the 2013, the agency created a giant dragon skull and installed it on Charmouth Beach on Dorset’s Jurassic coast—claiming it had washed ashore. (It was a stunt for HBO’s Game of Thrones.)
