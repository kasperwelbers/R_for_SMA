The coronation of King Charles III is just a couple days away and he's the first new British monarch to be crowned in 70 years. But according to recent polls, the majority of young people in the country don't seem to care for it. The royal event comes at a difficult time for the U.K. There's a cost of living crisis, strikes by health-care workers and the country is on its third prime minister in less than a year. With media estimates suggesting the coronation could cost British taxpayers 100 million pounds ($170 million CDN), are the Royal Family and their traditions out of touch with the lives of average British citizens? And if so, what could that mean for the future of the monarchy? Featuring: Anna Whitelock, British historian specializing in the history of the monarchy.

So, who was King Henry VIII and what made his reign so significant? To understand the impact of Henry’s rule, we must first look back to the Tudor period, a time of great transformation and turmoil in England. When Henry VIII came to power in 1509, the Tudor dynasty was still in its infancy. The young king was just 18 years old and full of energy and ambition. He was determined to strengthen the monarchy and establish himself as a powerful and influential leader.
