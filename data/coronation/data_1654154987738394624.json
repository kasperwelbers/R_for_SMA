However, Charles is also the head of state of 14 other countries. One of those is Jamaica, where Premier League football appears a much more popular British institution than the Royal Family. Jamaica‚Äôs government is keen to cut ties with the monarchy and for the country to become a republic - just as its Caribbean neighbour Barbados did in November 2021. The coronation takes place 4,500 miles from Jamaica‚Äôs capital Kingston. Many locals feel just as emotionally disconnected from the event as they do geographically.
