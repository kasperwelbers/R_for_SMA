Born in Mayfair, London and mother of 4 children: Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward. In February 1952, Elizabeth—then 25 years old—became queen of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon (known today as Sri Lanka), as well as head of the Commonwealth. The number of her realms varied over time as territories gained independence and some realms became republics. In 1977, Elizabeth marked the Silver Jubilee of her accession. Parties and events took place throughout the Commonwealth. In 2002, Elizabeth marked her Golden Jubilee, the 50th anniversary of her accession.
