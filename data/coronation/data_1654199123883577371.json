Her name was Victoria, and she would reign for over six decades, becoming one of the most iconic and influential monarchs in British history. To celebrate both her accession to the throne and her 20th birthday in 1839, a commemorative coin was produced by Rosland. With only 400 of these royally approved coins ever minted, this limited-edition piece is a testament to the enduring legacy of Queen Victoria and her impact on the world. Delve deeper into the story of Queen Victoria's reign, the original coin design, and the digital remastering that brought this stunning tribute to life. When Queen Victoria came to power in 1837, she inherited a nation in the midst of great transformation.
