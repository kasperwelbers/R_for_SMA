King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother). Born in Mayfair, London and mother of 4 children: Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward. In February 1952, Elizabeth—then 25 years old—became queen of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon (known today as Sri Lanka), as well as head of the Commonwealth. The number of her realms varied over time as territories gained independence and some realms became republics. In 1977, Elizabeth marked the Silver Jubilee of her accession. Parties and events took place throughout the Commonwealth. In 2002, Elizabeth marked her Golden Jubilee, the 50th anniversary of her accession. Elizabeth's 2012 Diamond Jubilee marked 60 years on the throne, and celebrations were held throughout her realms, the wider Commonwealth, and beyond.","unwound_url":"https://opensea.io/collection/queenelizabeth2realmsportrait2015"},{"start":195,"end":218,"url":"https://t.co/1gqecNUGh6","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/UKinIndia/status/1654070865909399553","display_url":"twitter.com/UKinIndia/stat…","images":{}}],"mentions":[{"start":85,"end":93,"username":"opensea","id":"946213559213555712"},{"start":120,"end":133,"username":"PrincesTrust","id":"57280159"}],"hashtags":[{"start":159,"end":170,"tag":"Coronation"},{"start":171,"end":189,"tag":"CoronationWeekend"},{"start":190,"end":194,"tag":"NFT"}],"cashtags":{}},"text":"We have a rare NFT in remembrance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II to 1 lucky buyer @opensea  % of the sale will go to @PrincesTrust \nhttps://t.co/mVDoyKCQge\n#Coronation #CoronationWeekend #NFT https://t.co/1gqecNUGh6","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"possibly_sensitive":false,"lang":"en","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1654213306284924930"],"conversation_id":"1654213306284924930","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":13},"created_at":"2023-05-04T19:56:00.000Z","id":"1654213306284924930","author_id":"1331307872559505412","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"quoted","id":"1654070865909399553"}],"geo":{}},{"entities":{"annotations":{},"urls":[{"start":173,"end":196,"url":"https://t.co/9M8TYnDkOG","expanded_url":"https://blog.justingredients.co.uk/recipes/platinum-jubilee-biscuits/","display_url":"blog.justingredients.co.uk/recipes/platin…","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1654213355664560131/J2uH5Bbo?format=jpg&name=orig","width":784,"height":392},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1654213355664560131/J2uH5Bbo?format=jpg&name=150x150","width":150,"height":150}],"status":200,"title":"Royal Biscuits 👑 | JustIngredients Blog","unwound_url":"https://blog.justingredients.co.uk/recipes/platinum-jubilee-biscuits/"},{"start":197,"end":220,"url":"https://t.co/cPWqoFm4UJ","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/JustIngredients/status/1654213304473059329/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/cPWqoFm4UJ","images":{},"media_key":"3_1650453903656230913"}],"mentions":{},"hashtags":{},"cashtags":{}},"text":"Whether you’re throwing a street party 🥳 or simply enjoying the extra day off, decorate these British biscuits with royal icing just in time for the King’s coronation! 🍪 👑\n\nhttps://t.co/9M8TYnDkOG https://t.co/cPWqoFm4UJ","attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1650453903656230913"],"poll_ids":{}},"possibly_sensitive":false,"lang":"en","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1654213304473059329"],"conversation_id":"1654213304473059329","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":12},"created_at":"2023-05-04T19:56:00.000Z","id":"1654213304473059329","author_id":"167357225","referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"entities":{"annotations":[{"start":25,"end":26,"probability":0.929,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"g'"},{"start":73,"end":79,"probability":0.6136,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"t | AP "}],"urls":[{"start":85,"end":108,"url":"https://t.co/WyCC5PJPnZ","expanded_url":"https://apnews.com/article/king-charles-coronation-opponents-republican-protest-6aab62a8c337568386914e6374a709be","display_url":"apnews.com/article/king-c…","status":200,"title":"'Not my king': UK republicans want coronation to be the last","description":"There will be dissenters among the cheering crowds when King Charles III travels by gilded coach to his coronation.

Born in Mayfair, London and mother of 4 children: Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward. In February 1952, Elizabeth—then 25 years old—became queen of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon (known today as Sri Lanka), as well as head of the Commonwealth.

The number of her realms varied over time as territories gained independence and some realms became republics. In 1977, Elizabeth marked the Silver Jubilee of her accession. Parties and events took place throughout the Commonwealth. In 2002, Elizabeth marked her Golden Jubilee, the 50th anniversary of her accession. Elizabeth's 2012 Diamond Jubilee marked 60 years on the throne, and celebrations were held throughout her realms, the wider Commonwealth, and beyond.","unwound_url":"https://opensea.io/collection/queenelizabeth2realmsportrait2015"},{"start":195,"end":218,"url":"https://t.co/3jJs3Kc5e9","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/UKinDenmark/status/1654055234153377792","display_url":"twitter.com/UKinDenmark/st…","images":{}}],"mentions":[{"start":85,"end":93,"username":"opensea","id":"946213559213555712"},{"start":120,"end":133,"username":"PrincesTrust","id":"57280159"}],"hashtags":[{"start":159,"end":170,"tag":"Coronation"},{"start":171,"end":189,"tag":"CoronationWeekend"},{"start":190,"end":194,"tag":"NFT"}],"cashtags":{}},"text":"We have a rare NFT in remembrance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II to 1 lucky buyer @opensea  % of the sale will go to @PrincesTrust \nhttps://t.co/mVDoyKCQge\n#Coronation #CoronationWeekend #NFT https://t.co/3jJs3Kc5e9","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"possibly_sensitive":false,"lang":"en","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1654212256836603904"],"conversation_id":"1654212256836603904","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":1,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":8},"created_at":"2023-05-04T19:51:50.000Z","id":"1654212256836603904","author_id":"1331307872559505412","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"quoted","id":"1654055234153377792"}],"geo":{}},{"entities":{"annotations":{},"urls":{},"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":15,"username":"NoContextBrits","id":"1377572924413124609"}],"hashtags":{},"cashtags":{}},"text":"@NoContextBrits Ignoring the coronation.","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"possibly_sensitive":false,"lang":"en","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1654212252910665734"],"conversation_id":"1654148564019298304","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":5},"created_at":"2023-05-04T19:51:49.000Z","id":"1654212252910665734","author_id":"1518348097633591296","in_reply_to_user_id":"1377572924413124609","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1654148564019298304"}],"geo":{}},{"entities":{"annotations":{},"urls":[{"start":111,"end":134,"url":"https://t.co/ASpEdCZ3zl","expanded_url":"https://apple.news/Apbz4o2qMROiIuwPYS6TbPw","display_url":"apple.news/Apbz4o2qMROiIu…","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1654212241938608130/j3RLgJW0?format=jpg&name=orig","width":750,"height":500},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1654212241938608130/j3RLgJW0?format=jpg&name=150x150","width":150,"height":150}],"status":200,"title":"Princess Anne Shares the Practical Reason She Accepted Her Coronation Role: 'Solves My Dress Problem'","description":"The Princess Royal had a lighthearted reply about why she decided to carry out her duties as Gold-Stick-in-Waiting at King Charles and Queen Camilla's coronation","unwound_url":"https://apple.news/Apbz4o2qMROiIuwPYS6TbPw"}],"mentions":{},"hashtags":{},"cashtags":{}},"text":"Princess Anne Shares the Practical Reason She Accepted Her Coronation Role: 'Solves My Dress Problem' -

21 April 1926 – 8 September 2022 the 1st child of Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother). Born in Mayfair, London and mother of 4 children: Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward. In February 1952, Elizabeth—then 25 years old—became queen of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon (known today as Sri Lanka), as well as head of the Commonwealth.
