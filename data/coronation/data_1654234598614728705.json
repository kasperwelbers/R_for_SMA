Opinion polls suggest opposition and apathy to the monarchy are both growing now that Charles has replaced Queen Elizabeth II who died in September after 70 years on the throne.","unwound_url":"https://apnews.com/article/king-charles-coronation-opponents-republican-protest-6aab62a8c337568386914e6374a709be"},{"start":86,"end":109,"url":"https://t.co/tiBnGi1TGp","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/BerneMuthien/status/1654237210705575936/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/tiBnGi1TGp","media_key":"3_1654237207475920898"}],"mentions":{},"hashtags":{},"annotations":[{"start":15,"end":16,"probability":0.9333,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"UK"}]},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":1,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":19},"created_at":"2023-05-04T21:30:59.000Z","lang":"en","conversation_id":"1654237210705575936","referenced_tweets":{},"id":"1654237210705575936","author_id":"947908634","text":"'Not my king': UK republicans want coronation to be the last\n\nhttps://t.co/jPNwpfplzW https://t.co/tiBnGi1TGp","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1654237210705575936"],"attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1654237207475920898"],"poll_ids":{}},"geo":{"coordinates":{"coordinates":{}}}},{"possibly_sensitive":false,"entities":{"urls":{},"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":9,"username":"guardian","id":"87818409"}],"hashtags":{},"annotations":[{"start":53,"end":57,"probability":0.5439,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"sunak"}]},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":1,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":261},"created_at":"2023-05-04T21:30:57.000Z","lang":"en","conversation_id":"1654211354658521089","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1654211354658521089"}],"id":"1654237201704574978","author_id":"922097429603864576","text":"@guardian i‚Äôm the farthest thing from a supporter of sunak. but as someone who is uninterested in the coronation, i‚Äôm definitely pretty grounded in british culture. we all know this is about his skin colour and where his parents were born","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1654237201704574978"],"in_reply_to_user_id":"87818409","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"geo":{"coordinates":{"coordinates":{}}}},{"possibly_sensitive":false,"entities":{"urls":{},"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":7,"username":"Ellekl","id":"871279201508261888"},{"start":8,"end":19,"username":"Sian_Eliza","id":"116423172"},{"start":20,"end":27,"username":"TalkTV","id":"3380282686"},{"start":28,"end":43,"username":"byEmilyAndrews","id":"2242373414"},{"start":44,"end":60,"username":"kinseyschofield","id":"15658327"}],"hashtags":{},"annotations":[{"start":107,"end":108,"probability":0.9756,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"UK"},{"start":133,"end":138,"probability":0.9714,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"London"}]},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":1,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":7},"created_at":"2023-05-04T21:30:57.000Z","lang":"en","conversation_id":"1653838445209604096","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1654207969628758017"}],"id":"1654237201629171713","author_id":"1638971399925559309","text":"@Ellekl @Sian_Eliza @TalkTV @byEmilyAndrews @kinseyschofield Lots actually.
