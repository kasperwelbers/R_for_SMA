Graham Smith of the campaigning group republic says the coronation is “a celebration of one man taking a job that he has not earned.” Republican activists see the coronation as a moment of opportunity. Opinion polls suggest opposition and apathy to the monarchy are both growing now that Charles has replaced Queen Elizabeth II who died in September after 70 years on the throne.","unwound_url":"https://apnews.com/article/king-charles-coronation-opponents-republican-protest-6aab62a8c337568386914e6374a709be"}],"cashtags":{}},"possibly_sensitive":false,"id":"1654244240694624258","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1654244240694624258"],"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":33},"conversation_id":"1654244240694624258","text":"I will be watching all the pomp&amp;circumstance ⁦@BBCWorld⁩ from 5am Saturday wt tea &amp; sandwiches.
