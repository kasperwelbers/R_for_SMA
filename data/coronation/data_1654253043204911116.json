Brexit is the word that must never be spoken. Conservative must never be seen in a Tory bio. Now they are rigging elections by voter suppression. We need a Detective who can dig out the crimes and serve them up on a platter. It's time to take the Fascist Tories Out with the Trash. Who will be the one to do it? The great detective, or the people? (My Money is on the People, if the lack of ID didn't prevent them from voting...
