Plain, airy cakes, sandwiched with sweet jam and smooth, whipped cream: it is no wonder that it has been such a favourite through the generations. My version tinkers only a little with the traditional model: I use a mixture of flour and cornflour/cornstarch in the sponge, which creates cakes that are exceptionally light and tender; and I add some fruit along with the jam. Here, I‚Äôve used raspberry jam and raspberries, but I can tell you that some sliced strawberries with strawberry jam, or blackberries with their corresponding jam, are also to be considered. Should you decide you wish to leave out the fruit, which in winter may be necessary, I‚Äôd add perhaps a little more jam, sharpened with a good spritz of lemon juice. Anyway, this is the Victoria Sponge I‚Äôve been making for decades, and I‚Äôm absolutely thrilled that it is now on the site. I don‚Äôt advise making this in advance, as it stales quickly.
