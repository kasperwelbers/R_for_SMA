I could understand why Prince would want to leave right after the coronation to fly home for Archie's birthday. Good thing it's a long flight. He can get rest on the plane. To be there for Archie. At least he made the effort to be at the coronation.

Here, I‚Äôve used raspberry jam and raspberries, but I can tell you that some sliced strawberries with strawberry jam, or blackberries with their corresponding jam, are also to be considered. Should you decide you wish to leave out the fruit, which in winter may be necessary, I‚Äôd add perhaps a little more jam, sharpened with a good spritz of lemon juice.
