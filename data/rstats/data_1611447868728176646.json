T-DNA insertion lines provided an invaluable resource of mutants and enabled systematic reverse genetics-based investigation of the functions of Arabidopsis thaliana genes during the last decades. Results We sequenced the genomes of 14 A. thaliana GABI-Kat T-DNA insertion lines, which eluded flanking sequence tag-based attempts to characterize their insertion loci, with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long reads. Complex T-DNA insertions were resolved and 11 previously unknown T-DNA loci identified, resulting in about 2 T-DNA insertions per line and suggesting that this number was previously underestimated. T-DNA mutagenesis caused fusions of chromosomes along with compensating translocations to keep the gene set complete throughout meiosis. Also, an inverted duplication of 800 kbp was detected. About 10 % of GABI-Kat lines might be affected by chromosomal rearrangements, some of which ","unwound_url":"https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-021-07877-8"},{"start":281,"end":304,"url":"https://t.co/Gj40hBLWSE","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/MiningGenome/status/1611962691765305345/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/Gj40hBLWSE","images":{},"media_key":"3_1611961489102872576"}]},"conversation_id":"1611962691765305345","author_id":"1286188078999248896","possibly_sensitive":false,"text":"Genotyping A. thaliana T-DNA lines with long reads\nhttps://t.co/4bqW48GdS4\n#Bioinformatics #Genomics #OpenScience #DataScience #100DaysOfCode #serverless #Linux #WomenWhoCode #BigData #MachineLearning #Python #coding #SciComm #phdchat #Rstats #AcademicChatter #SciTwitter #retweet https://t.co/Gj40hBLWSE","id":"1611962691765305345","attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1611961489102872576"]},"geo":{}},{"referenced_tweets":{},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":36,"reply_count":3,"like_count":108,"quote_count":1,"impression_count":6237},"lang":"en","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1611961401970511873"],"created_at":"2023-01-08T05:42:01.000Z","entities":{"annotations":[{"start":20,"end":26,"probability":0.447,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"BigData"},{"start":53,"end":54,"probability":0.497,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"AI"},{"start":74,"end":76,"probability":0.4727,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"IoT"},{"start":79,"end":82,"probability":0.4884,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"IIoT"},{"start":85,"end":91,"probability":0.5628,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"PyTorch"},{"start":94,"end":99,"probability":0.905,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"Python"},{"start":102,"end":107,"probability":0.4239,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"RStats"},{"start":110,"end":119,"probability":0.6377,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"TensorFlow"},{"start":122,"end":131,"probability":0.91,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"JavaScript"},{"start":134,"end":140,"probability":0.5263,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"ReactJS"},{"start":143,"end":148,"probability":0.5711,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"GoLang"},{"start":194,"end":198,"probability":0.914,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"Linux"}],"mentions":{},"hashtags":[{"start":19,"end":27,"tag":"BigData"},{"start":28,"end":38,"tag":"Analytics"},{"start":39,"end":51,"tag":"DataScience"},{"start":52,"end":55,"tag":"AI"},{"start":56,"end":72,"tag":"MachineLearning"},{"start":73,"end":77,"tag":"IoT"},{"start":78,"end":83,"tag":"IIoT"},{"start":84,"end":92,"tag":"PyTorch"},{"start":93,"end":100,"tag":"Python"},{"start":101,"end":108,"tag":"RStats"},{"start":109,"end":120,"tag":"TensorFlow"},{"start":121,"end":132,"tag":"JavaScript"},{"start":133,"end":141,"tag":"ReactJS"},{"start":142,"end":149,"tag":"GoLang"},{"start":150,"end":165,"tag":"CloudComputing"},{"start":166,"end":177,"tag":"Serverless"},{"start":178,"end":192,"tag":"DataScientist"},{"start":193,"end":199,"tag":"Linux"},{"start":200,"end":211,"tag":"Statistics"},{"start":212,"end":218,"tag":"Books"},{"start":219,"end":231,"tag":"Programming"},{"start":232,"end":239,"tag":"Coding"},{"start":240,"end":254,"tag":"100DaysofCode"}],"urls":[{"start":256,"end":279,"url":"https://t.co/AhoEcYHcD0","expanded_url":"https://geni.us/All-of-Stats","display_url":"geni.us/All-of-Stats","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1611961415698448385/mXTMr8VT?format=png&name=orig","width":600,"height":315},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1611961415698448385/mXTMr8VT?format=png&name=150x150","width":150,"height":150}],"status":200,"title":"All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference (Springer Texts in Statistics)","description":"Taken literally, the title \"All of Statistics\" is an exaggeration.
