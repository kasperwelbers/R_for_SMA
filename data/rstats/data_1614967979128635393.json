Here, a U-net deep learning model was used to map monthly tropical tree cover in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso between 2015 and 2021 using 5 m spatial resolution Planet NICFI satellite images. The accuracy of the tree cover model was extremely high, with an F1-score >0.98, further confirmed by an independent LiDAR validation showing that 95% of tree cover pixels had a height >5 m while 98% of non-tree cover pixels had a height <5 m. The biannual map of deforestation was then built from the monthly tree cover map. The deforestation map showed relatively consistent agreement with the official deforestation map from Brazil (67.2%) but deviated significantly from Global Forest Change (GFC)’s year of forest loss, showing that our product is closest to the product made by visual interpretation. Finally, we estimated that 14.8% of Mato Grosso’s total area h","unwound_url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/15/2/521"},{"start":251,"end":274,"url":"https://t.co/YRVkHyt4SY","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/FabienWagner/status/1615235092795871232/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/YRVkHyt4SY","images":{},"media_key":"3_1615040114207625216"}],"mentions":[{"start":178,"end":191,"username":"NICFISatData","id":"1564170938240966657"},{"start":192,"end":199,"username":"planet","id":"17663776"},{"start":200,"end":209,"username":"UCLAIoES","id":"90982474"},{"start":210,"end":221,"username":"CTrees_org","id":"1568324216747098112"}],"cashtags":{}},"created_at":"2023-01-17T06:30:30.000Z","author_id":"76086027","conversation_id":"1615235092795871232","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":40,"reply_count":1,"like_count":182,"quote_count":3,"impression_count":16423},"possibly_sensitive":false,"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"text":"Step by Step Guide for Activation Functions. #BigData #Analytics #DataScience #AI #MachineLearning #IoT #IIoT #Python #RStats #TensorFlow #Java #JavaScript #ReactJS #CloudComputing #Serverless #DataScientist #Linux #Programming #Coding #100DaysofCode   \nhttps://t.co/N0kA0o8bGG https://t.co/dxydHEWRex","attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1615233961323642880","3_1615233964578426880","3_1615233967812218881","3_1615233971708739585"]},"id":"1615233974812512257","lang":"en","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1615233974812512257"],"entities":{"hashtags":[{"start":45,"end":53,"tag":"BigData"},{"start":54,"end":64,"tag":"Analytics"},{"start":65,"end":77,"tag":"DataScience"},{"start":78,"end":81,"tag":"AI"},{"start":82,"end":98,"tag":"MachineLearning"},{"start":99,"end":103,"tag":"IoT"},{"start":104,"end":109,"tag":"IIoT"},{"start":110,"end":117,"tag":"Python"},{"start":118,"end":125,"tag":"RStats"},{"start":126,"end":137,"tag":"TensorFlow"},{"start":138,"end":143,"tag":"Java"},{"start":144,"end":155,"tag":"JavaScript"},{"start":156,"end":164,"tag":"ReactJS"},{"start":165,"end":180,"tag":"CloudComputing"},{"start":181,"end":192,"tag":"Serverless"},{"start":193,"end":207,"tag":"DataScientist"},{"start":208,"end":214,"tag":"Linux"},{"start":215,"end":227,"tag":"Programming"},{"start":228,"end":235,"tag":"Coding"},{"start":236,"end":250,"tag":"100DaysofCode"}],"annotations":[{"start":46,"end":52,"probability":0.524,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"BigData"},{"start":79,"end":80,"probability":0.4406,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"AI"},{"start":100,"end":102,"probability":0.5316,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"IoT"},{"start":111,"end":116,"probability":0.9104,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"Python"},{"start":119,"end":124,"probability":0.4802,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"RStats"},{"start":127,"end":136,"probability":0.6458,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"TensorFlow"},{"start":139,"end":142,"probability":0.8335,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"Java"},{"start":145,"end":154,"probability":0.9151,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"JavaScript"},{"start":157,"end":163,"probability":0.4931,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"ReactJS"},{"start":166,"end":179,"probability":0.5014,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"CloudComputing"},{"start":209,"end":213,"probability":0.93,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"Linux"}],"urls":[{"start":254,"end":277,"url":"https://t.co/N0kA0o8bGG","expanded_url":"https://geni.us/Step-by-Step-G","display_url":"geni.us/Step-by-Step-G","status":200,"title":"A new activation function for Neural Networks - logmoid","description":"The activation function defines the output given an input or set of inputs for the neuron in a neural network.

These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time.

Causal Effects from Panel Data with Dynamic Multivariate Panel Models","description":"Panel data are ubiquitous in scientific domains such as sociology and econometrics. Various modeling approaches have been presented for the analysis of such data including dynamic panel models, cross-lagged panel models, and their extensions. Existing panel data modeling approaches typically impose some restrictive assumptions on the data-generating process, such as Gaussian errors, effects that are constant in time, or univariate responses. With the goal of surmounting these restrictions, we present the dynamic multivariate panel model (DMPM) that supports both time-varying and time-invariant effects, multiple simultaneous responses across a wide variety of distributions, and arbitrary dependency structures of lagged responses of any order. We employ a Bayesian approach to the estimation of the model parameters and leverage state-of-the-art Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for simulation of the posterior distribution.
