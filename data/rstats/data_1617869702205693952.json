Current approaches rely on engineered retroviral vectors to randomly integrate copy(s) of gene-of-interest in autologous hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) genome permanently to provide gene function in transduced HSPCs and their progenies. To circumvent concerns related to potential genotoxicities due to the random vector integrations in HSPCs, targeted correction with CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing offers improved precision for functional correction of multiple IEIs. MethodsWe compare the two approaches for integration of IL2RG transgene for functional correction of HSPCs from patients with X-linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID-X1 or XSCID); delivery via current clinical lentivector (LV)-IL2RG versus targeted insertion (TI) of IL2RG via homology-directed repair (HDR) when using an adeno-associate","unwound_url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2022.1067417/full"},{"start":233,"end":256,"url":"https://t.co/z4aSjX8x3I","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/Primary_Immune/status/1617979850652020738/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/z4aSjX8x3I","images":{},"media_key":"3_1617979713108037647"}],"annotations":[{"start":115,"end":120,"probability":0.5535,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"X-SCID"}],"mentions":{},"cashtags":{}},"author_id":"79975924","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1617979850652020738"],"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":7,"reply_count":1,"like_count":12,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":1390},"attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1617979713108037647"],"poll_ids":{}},"text":"🧬DNA-editing✂️for 'Bubble-Babies\"\n     -&gt;  \"Strong rationale for a clinical trial\n             for treatment of X-SCID patients\"\nhttps://t.co/gK55Y3KwKM #bioinformatics #rstats #openscience #snrtg #CRISPR #raredisease #immunology https://t.co/z4aSjX8x3I","lang":"en","possibly_sensitive":false,"id":"1617979850652020738","conversation_id":"1617979850652020738","referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"created_at":"2023-01-24T20:16:50.000Z","entities":{"hashtags":[{"start":93,"end":105,"tag":"tidyTuesday"},{"start":213,"end":220,"tag":"rstats"}],"urls":[{"start":228,"end":251,"url":"https://t.co/PGjIt8OlJ2","expanded_url":"https://github.com/AlbertRapp/PublicTidyTuesday/blob/main/2023-w04-alone/2023-w04-alone.qmd","display_url":"github.com/AlbertRapp/Pub…","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1617979765851553793/qhBBUZmc?format=jpg&name=orig","width":1200,"height":600},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1617979765851553793/qhBBUZmc?format=jpg&name=150x150","width":150,"height":150}],"status":200,"title":"PublicTidyTuesday/2023-w04-alone.qmd at main · AlbertRapp/PublicTidyTuesday","description":"Repository for sharing tidy Tuesday files.
