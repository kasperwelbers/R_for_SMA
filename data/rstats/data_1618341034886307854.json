We present a 7-year-old APLAID patient who has recurrent blistering skin lesions, skin infections in the perineum, a rectal perineal fistula, and inflammatory bowel disease.MethodsTo determine the genetic cause of our patient, WES and bioinformatics analysis were performed. Flow cytometry was used for phenotyping immune cell populations in peripheral blood. Cytokines released into plasma were analyzed using protein chip technology. The PBMCs of patient and a healthy child were subjected to single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis.ResultsThe patient carried a novel de novo missense mutation c.2534T>C in exon 24 of the PLCG2 gene that causes a leucine to serine amino acid substitution (p.Leu845Ser). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that this mutation had a negative impact on the structure of the PLCγ2 protein, which is highly conserved in many other species.

metacells.","unwound_url":"https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.rbind.io/post/how-to-do-gene-correlation-for-single-cell-rnaseq-data-part-2-using-meta-cell/"},{"start":137,"end":160,"url":"https://t.co/kYew2rEAEy","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/tangming2005/status/1615362624849428482","display_url":"twitter.com/tangming2005/s…","images":{}}],"annotations":[{"start":55,"end":60,"probability":0.7545,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"RNAseq"},{"start":72,"end":79,"probability":0.6509,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"metacell"},{"start":108,"end":113,"probability":0.4795,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"rstats"},{"start":128,"end":135,"probability":0.4987,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"metacell"}],"hashtags":[{"start":107,"end":114,"tag":"rstats"},{"start":115,"end":126,"tag":"singlecell"},{"start":127,"end":136,"tag":"metacell"}],"mentions":{},"cashtags":{}},"possibly_sensitive":false,"id":"1618693397342203904","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1618693397342203904"],"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":5,"reply_count":0,"like_count":17,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":5575},"conversation_id":"1618693397342203904","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"text":"How

Monitoring such purchases may provide an opportunity for earlier diagnosis. Objective: The aim of the Cancer Loyalty Card Study (CLOCS) was to investigate purchases of OTC pain and indigestion medications prior to ovarian cancer diagnosis in women with and without ovarian cancer in the United Kingdom using loyalty card data. Methods: An observational case-control study was performed comparing purchases of OTC pain and indigestion medications prior to diagnosis in women with (n=153) and without (n=120) ovarian cancer using loyalty card data from two UK-based high street retailers. Monthly purchases of pain and indigestion medications for cases and controls were compared using the Fisher exact test, conditional logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.

The course aims to teach you how to code matrix algebra operations in R, and with main C++ matrix algebra libraries: RcppArmadillo and RcppEigen. Moreover, to clarify the matrix algebra operations, a simple algorithm is provided to understand the computing implications. The provided matrix algebra operations range from matrix summation and matrix multiplication to LU factorization and eigendecomposition. The main course outcome is to develop hands-on experience via curated programs to perform the matrix algebra computation in the R and Rcpp ecosystem, also including the ability to develop algorithms for areas such as machine learning, image processing and signal processing.","unwound_url":"https://www.educative.io/collection/10370001/4727811482320896"},{"start":170,"end":193,"url":"https://t.co/Y2pf3gGgWy","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/mariodetoma/status/1618649325122510850/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/Y2pf3gGgWy","images":{},"media_key":"3_1618649320609169430"}],"annotations":[{"start":19,"end":42,"probability":0.7533,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"Computing Matrix Algebra"},{"start":49,"end":54,"probability":0.4557,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"rstats"},{"start":57,"end":60,"probability":0.5005,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"Rcpp"},{"start":63,"end":75,"probability":0.5596,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"RcppArmadillo"},{"start":83,"end":91,"probability":0.627,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"RcppEigen"}],"hashtags":[{"start":48,"end":55,"tag":"rstats"}],"mentions":{},"cashtags":{}},"possibly_sensitive":false,"id":"1618649325122510850","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1618649325122510850"],"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":1,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":230},"conversation_id":"1618649325122510850","attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1618649320609169430"]},"text":"eventually my book Computing Matrix Algebra (in #rstats, Rcpp, RcppArmadillo &amp; RcppEigen) became an interactive course published by Educative\nhttps://t.co/NM6AutRcj9 https://t.co/Y2pf3gGgWy","lang":"en","author_id":"3395169995","created_at":"2023-01-26T16:37:26.000Z","referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"entities":{"urls":[{"start":72,"end":95,"url":"https://t.co/YiJoJigkoG","expanded_url":"https://m.bilibilicomics.com/share/reader/mc97?utm_source=app_share_twitter&utm_medium=skiptimemission&systemLang=en&yh=NTUyMzE1NTAwMg==&share_template=1_15&hashtag=RStats,free,Mr","display_url":"m.bilibilicomics.com/share/reader/m…","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1618649187759058944/8ZLY8F0T?format=jpg&name=orig","width":995,"height":560},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1618649187759058944/8ZLY8F0T?format=jpg&name=150x150","width":150,"height":150}],"status":200,"title":"The Martial Emperor's Life After Seclusion read comic online - BILIBILI COMICS","description":"Read The Martial Emperor's Life After Seclusion online free at Bilibili Comics.

Figure 1: The Effect of Ordinal Class Rank on quite a few outcome variables But with (too) many outcome variables comes a risk: inflated type 1 error rates, or an increased risk of ‘false positives’.

Common regression models, such as logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression, are automatically identified and the tables are pre-filled with appropriate column headers.","unwound_url":"https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/"}],"annotations":[{"start":1,"end":9,"probability":0.6861,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"gtsummary"},{"start":28,"end":31,"probability":0.6298,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"CRAN"},{"start":118,"end":122,"probability":0.5351,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"dplyr"},{"start":239,"end":244,"probability":0.3574,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"rstats"}],"hashtags":[{"start":0,"end":10,"tag":"gtsummary"},{"start":238,"end":245,"tag":"rstats"},{"start":246,"end":258,"tag":"datascience"}],"mentions":[{"start":196,"end":209,"username":"J_Larmarange","id":"460003268"}],"cashtags":{}},"possibly_sensitive":false,"id":"1618608695021293572","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1618608695021293572"],"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":26,"reply_count":5,"like_count":142,"quote_count":2,"impression_count":20151},"conversation_id":"1618608695021293572","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"text":"#gtsummary v1.7.0 is now on CRAN!🐘🕺🪩\n\nWhat I thought would be a small release to account me a small change in the new dplyr, turned into a great release with many new features (primarily added by @J_Larmarange)!\n\nhttps://t.co/DkXk3jD2RS\n\n#rstats #datascience","lang":"en","author_id":"853839421","created_at":"2023-01-26T13:55:59.000Z","referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"entities":{"urls":[{"start":258,"end":281,"url":"https://t.co/1nDiSbbqsx","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/EconomicsShiny/status/1618608658128015360/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/1nDiSbbqsx","media_key":"3_1618608655149957120"}],"annotations":[{"start":251,"end":256,"probability":0.4321,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"rstats"}],"hashtags":[{"start":242,"end":249,"tag":"claims"},{"start":250,"end":257,"tag":"rstats"}],"mentions":{},"cashtags":{}},"possibly_sensitive":false,"id":"1618608658128015360","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1618608658128015360"],"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":1,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":267},"conversation_id":"1618608658128015360","attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1618608655149957120"]},"text":"Longer-term view of Weekly Claims data.

The package allows users to assess VLFs in aligned and trimmed protein-coding sequences by automatically calculating the frequency of nucleotides or amino acids in each sequence position and outputting those that occur under a user-specified frequency (default of p = 0.001). These results can then be used to explore fundamental population genetic and phylogeographic patterns, mechanisms and processes at the microevolutionary level, such as nucleotide and amino acid sequence conservation.Our package extends earlier work pertaining to an implementation of VLF analysis in Microsoft Excel, which was found to be both computationally slow and error prone.

Because of the richness of the Danish register data, I had a large number of potential outcome variables at my disposal, and as a result, I was able to examine literally all the outcomes that the previous literature had covered in individual studies - the effect of rank on achievement, personality, risky behaviour, mental health, parental investment, etc. - in one paper. Figure 1: The Effect of Ordinal Class Rank on quite a few outcome variables But with (too) many outcome variables comes a risk: inflated type 1 error rates, or an increased risk of ‘false positives’. So I was wondering: were all the significant effects I estimated - shown in the figure above - “real”, or was I simply being fooled by randomness?
