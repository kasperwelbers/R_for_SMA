- CRAN Task View","description":"The aim of this form is to build a database of R packages used by the palaeontological community. Using this community knowledge and experience, the database will be used to develop a CRAN Task View for Palaeontology. CRAN Task Views serve two main purposes: (1) provide detailed information about individual packages, and (2) provide the ability to download all packages in the task view at once via the ctv R package (for those available on CRAN). This CRAN Task View will provide palaeontologists with a curated list of R packages suitable for various analyses which can be conducted in R, and let the community know what tools are available. If you wish to contribute to this aim and have any suggestions, please complete the form below. A form should be submitted for each suggested package. Both CRAN R packages and other non-CRAN packages are welcome. We would also like to say thank you in advance for your contribution.

Maneuver Decision Making of Dual-UAV Cooperative Air Combat Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning","description":"Autonomous maneuver decision making is the core of intelligent warfare, which has become the main research direction to enable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to independently generate control commands and complete air combat tasks according to environmental situation information. In this paper, an autonomous maneuver decision making method is proposed for air combat by two cooperative UAVs, which is showcased by using the typical olive formation strategy as a practical example. First, a UAV situation assessment model based on the relative situation is proposed, which uses the real-time target and UAV location information to assess the current situation or threat. Second, the continuous air combat state space is discretized into a 13 dimensional space for dimension reduction and quantitative description, and 15 typical action commands instead of a continuous control space are designed to reduce the difficulty of UAV training. Third, a reward function is designed based on the situation ","unwound_url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/11/3/467"},{"start":251,"end":274,"url":"https://t.co/0HoclTwlgU","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/gp_pulipaka/status/1622489650119032833/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/0HoclTwlgU","media_key":"3_1622489635661168641"},{"start":251,"end":274,"url":"https://t.co/0HoclTwlgU","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/gp_pulipaka/status/1622489650119032833/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/0HoclTwlgU","media_key":"3_1622489641336074241"},{"start":251,"end":274,"url":"https://t.co/0HoclTwlgU","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/gp_pulipaka/status/1622489650119032833/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/0HoclTwlgU","media_key":"3_1622489644230184961"},{"start":251,"end":274,"url":"https://t.co/0HoclTwlgU","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/gp_pulipaka/status/1622489650119032833/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/0HoclTwlgU","media_key":"3_1622489647241695232"}],"annotations":[{"start":42,"end":48,"probability":0.5631,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"BigData"},{"start":75,"end":76,"probability":0.4005,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"AI"},{"start":96,"end":98,"probability":0.5556,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"IoT"},{"start":101,"end":104,"probability":0.4904,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"IIoT"},{"start":107,"end":112,"probability":0.9139,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"Python"},{"start":115,"end":120,"probability":0.4718,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"RStats"},{"start":123,"end":132,"probability":0.6304,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"TensorFlow"},{"start":135,"end":144,"probability":0.9112,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"JavaScript"},{"start":147,"end":153,"probability":0.4902,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"ReactJS"},{"start":184,"end":188,"probability":0.9273,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"Linux"}],"hashtags":[{"start":41,"end":49,"tag":"BigData"},{"start":50,"end":60,"tag":"Analytics"},{"start":61,"end":73,"tag":"DataScience"},{"start":74,"end":77,"tag":"AI"},{"start":78,"end":94,"tag":"MachineLearning"},{"start":95,"end":99,"tag":"IoT"},{"start":100,"end":105,"tag":"IIoT"},{"start":106,"end":113,"tag":"Python"},{"start":114,"end":121,"tag":"RStats"},{"start":122,"end":133,"tag":"TensorFlow"},{"start":134,"end":145,"tag":"JavaScript"},{"start":146,"end":154,"tag":"ReactJS"},{"start":155,"end":170,"tag":"CloudComputing"},{"start":171,"end":182,"tag":"Serverless"},{"start":183,"end":189,"tag":"Linux"},{"start":190,"end":202,"tag":"Programming"},{"start":203,"end":210,"tag":"Coding"},{"start":211,"end":225,"tag":"100DaysofCode"}],"mentions":{}},"attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1622489635661168641","3_1622489641336074241","3_1622489644230184961","3_1622489647241695232"]},"id":"1622489650119032833","created_at":"2023-02-06T06:57:31.000Z","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1622489650119032833"],"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"lang":"en","author_id":"4263007693","conversation_id":"1622489524084547584","text":"#AI Best: A Greater Foundation for #MachineLearning.  \n@bigdataconf\n #BigData #Analytics #DataScience #AI #IoT #IIoT #Python #RStats #TensorFlow #JavaScript #ReactJS #CloudComputing #Serverless #DataScientist #Linux #Programming #Coding #100DaysofCode  \nhttps://t.co/HyEjC6lLEi https://t.co/EfNZXEyjaf","possibly_sensitive":false,"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":4,"reply_count":0,"like_count":10,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":626},"entities":{"urls":[{"start":254,"end":277,"url":"https://t.co/HyEjC6lLEi","expanded_url":"https://bit.ly/3D9X7G7","display_url":"bit.ly/3D9X7G7","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1642360505376317441/9vABgS6p?format=png&name=orig","width":129,"height":129},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1642360505376317441/9vABgS6p?format=png&name=150x150","width":129,"height":129}],"status":200,"title":"Event Speaker -

R2R3-MYB gene family in banana (Musa acuminata): Genome-wide identification, classification and expression patterns","description":"The R2R3-MYB genes comprise one of the largest transcription factor gene families in plants, playing regulatory roles in plant-specific developmental processes, defense responses and metabolite accumulation. To date MYB family genes have not yet been comprehensively identified in the major staple fruit crop banana. In this study, we present a comprehensive, genome-wide analysis of the MYB genes from Musa acuminata DH-Pahang (A genome). A total of 285 R2R3-MYB genes as well as genes encoding three other classes of MYB proteins containing multiple MYB repeats were identified and characterised with respect to structure and chromosomal organisation. Organ- and development-specific expression patterns were determined from RNA-Seq data. For 280 M. acuminata MYB genes for which expression was found in at least one of the analysed samples, a variety of expression patterns were detected.

C. tiglium can be found in subtropical and tropical regions on both hemispheres (Salatino et al., 2007). This plant was first mentioned in the medical literature over 2,200 years ago in China. The medical relevance is probably due to a huge variety of different secondary metabolites (Pope, 1824). Traditionally utilized as a purgative to treat gastrointestinal and intestinal disorders, as an abortifacient and counterirritant, the commercially available seed oil of C. tiglium is nowadays applied in homoeopathy and acupuncture (Gläser et al., 1988). The pharmacologic mechanism of the laxative properties of ethanol extracts of C. tiglium has been studied on rat intestinal epithelium (Tsai et al., 2004).

However, the analysis of genomic data remains challenging and relies mostly on the performance of automatic pipelines. Frequently applied pipelines involve the alignment of sequence reads against a reference sequence and the identification of sequence variants. Since most benchmarking studies of bioinformatics tools for this purpose have been conducted on human datasets, there is a lack of benchmarking studies in plant sciences. In this study, we evaluated the performance of 50 different variant calling pipelines, including five read mappers and ten variant callers, on six real plant datasets of the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana . Sets of variants were evaluated based on various parameters including sensitivity and specificity. We found that all investigated tools are suitable for analysis of NGS data in plant research.
