Depending on the dplyr verb, the per-operation grouping argument may be named .by or by. The Supported verbs section below outlines this on a case-by-case basis. The remainder of this page will refer to .by for simplicity. Grouping radically affects the computation of the dplyr verb you use it with, and one of the goals of .by is to allow you to place that grouping specification alongside the code that actually uses it. As an added benefit, with .by you no longer need to remember to ungroup() after summarise(), and summarise() won't ever message you about how it's handling the groups! This idea comes from data.table, which allows you to specify by alongside modifications in j, like: dt[, .(x = mean(x)), by = g].

This paper addresses this gap. The new methodology builds upon tidy data principles, with the goal of integrating missing value handling as a key part of data analysis workflows. We define a new data structure, and a suite of new operations. Together, these provide a connected framework for handling, exploring, and imputing missing values.
