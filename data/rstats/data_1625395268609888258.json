This workshop deals with the analysis and modelling of population dynamics. In this introductory workshop, we will cover population projection matrix models, the estimation of demographic parameters (e.g. survival, dispersal) using capture-recapture models and the estimation of population density and abundance using capture-recapture, N-mixture and distance sampling models. The format of the workshop will be a combination of lectures and practical sessions in R with packages popbio, RMark and unmarked. The workshop is online, free of charge, and will be video recorded.

While this phenomenon has been exhaustively studied in Europe, with repeated attempts to model the speed of Neolithic diffusion based on radiocarbon dates, much less attention has been devoted to the dispersal towards the East, and in particular to South Asia. The Neolithic in the latter region at least partly derived from southwest Asia, given the presence of “founder crops” such as wheat and barley. The process of their eastward diffusion, however, may have been significantly different to the westward dispersal, which was mainly due to demic diffusion, as local domesticates were already available and farming was already practiced in parts of South Asia. Here, we use radiocarbon dates specifically related to the spread of the southwest Asian Neolithic crops to model the speed of dispersal o","unwound_url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0268482"}],"cashtags":{}},"possibly_sensitive":false,"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":6,"reply_count":3,"like_count":8,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":1114},"author_id":"1525589353790992389","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"conversation_id":"1625546842078613505","created_at":"2023-02-14T17:25:43.000Z","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1625546842078613505"],"text":"There are now 328 #archaeology papers that include #rstats code, with 6 published in 2023.

causing unprovoked or exaggerated systemic inflammation. Diagnosis of monogenic AID requires an accurate description of the patients’ phenotype, and the identification of highly penetrant genetic variants in single genes is pivotal. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) of 125 pediatric patients with suspected monogenic AID in a routine genetic diagnostic setting. Datasets were analyzed in a step-wise approach to identify the most feasible diagnostic strategy. First, we analyzed a virtual gene panel including 13 genes associated with known AID and, if no genetic diagnosis was established, we then analyzed a virtual panel including 542 genes published by the International Union of Immunological Societies associated including all known inborn error of immunity (IEI). Subsequently, WES data was analyzed without pre-filtering for known AID/IEI genes.
