In several ant genera symbiotic interactions with microbial communities have been shown to have profound impacts for the host. For example, we know that for Camponotini the gut community can upgrade the host’s diet and is shaped by development and colony interactions. However, what is true for one ant group may not be true for another. For the microbial communities that have been examined across ants we see variation in the diversity, host factors that structure these communities, and the function these microbes provide for the host. In the herbivorous turtle ants (Cephalotes) their stable symbiotic interactions with gut bacteria have persisted for 50 million years with the gut bacteria synthesizing essential amino acids that are used by the host.

critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) usually includes multiorgan dysfunction and subsequent death. Owing to the heterogeneity, complexity, and unpredictability of the disease progression, ICU patient care is challenging. Identifying the predictors of complicated courses and subsequent mortality at the early stages of the disease and recognizing the trajectory of the disease from the vast array of longitudinal quantitative clinical data is difficult. Therefore, we attempted to perform a meta-analysis of previously published gene expression datasets to identify novel early biomarkers and train the artificial intelligence systems to recognize the disease trajectories and subsequent clinical outcomes. Using the gene expression profile of peripheral blood cells obtained within 24 h of pediatric ICU (PICU) admission and numerous clinical data from 228 septic patients from pediatric ICU, we identified

Smooth Effects on Response Penalty for CLM","description":"A regularization method for the cumulative link models. The smooth-effect-on-response penalty (SERP) provides flexible modelling of the ordinal model by enabling the smooth transition from the general cumulative link model to a coarser form of the same model. In other words, as the tuning parameter goes from zero to infinity, the subject-specific effects associated with each variable in the model tend to a unique global effect. The parameter estimates of the general cumulative model are mostly unidentifiable or at least only identifiable within a range of the entire parameter space. Thus, by maximizing a penalized rather than the usual non-penalized log-likelihood, this and other numerical problems common with the general model are to a large extent eliminated. Fitting is via a modified Newton's method. Several standard model performance and descriptive methods are also available. For more details on the penalty implemented here, see, Ugba (2021) <doi:10.21105/joss.03705> and Ugba et

Eagleson and Weber (1978) and Silverman (1976) establish Strong Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorems for such arrays. Because non-sparse networks and multiway clustering are related to exchangeable arrays, they have received recent attention in statistics and econometrics (Davezies, D’Haultfœuille, and Guyonvarch (2018), Davezies, D’Haultfœuille, and Guyonvarch (2021), Menzel (2018)). We focus below on non-sparse networks and present uniformity results at the basis of the asymptotic normality of many nonlinear estimators. We also show the general validity of a bootstrap scheme adapted to such data. Non-sparse Networks, Dyadic data and exchangeability Dyadic data are random variables (or vectors) \\(Y_{i,j}\\) indexed by \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), two units from the same population.

Statistics in Non-Sparse Networks | R-bloggers","description":"Exchangeable arrays have been studied since the late 70’s (Aldous (1983), Kallenberg (2005)). Eagleson and Weber (1978) and Silverman (1976) establish Strong Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorems for such arrays. Because non-sparse networks and multiway clustering are related to exchangeable arrays, they have received recent attention in statistics and econometrics (Davezies, D’Haultfœuille, and Guyonvarch (2018), Davezies, D’Haultfœuille, and Guyonvarch (2021), Menzel (2018)). We focus below on non-sparse networks and present uniformity results at the basis of the asymptotic normality of many nonlinear estimators. We also show the general validity of a bootstrap scheme adapted to such data. Non-sparse Networks, Dyadic data and exchangeability Dyadic data are random variables (or vectors) \\(Y_{i,j}\\) indexed by \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), two units from the same population. For instance, \\(Y_{i,j}\\) could be exports from country \\(i\\) to country \\(j\\).

Hadoop and Mapreduce Interview Questions and Answers","description":"Apache Hadoop and Mapreduce Interview Questions has a collection of 120+ questions with answers asked in the interview for freshers and experienced (Programming, Scenario-Based, Fundamentals, Performance Tuning based Question and Answer). This  course is intended to help Apache Hadoop and Mapreduce Career Aspirants to prepare for the interview. We are planning to add more questions in upcoming versions of this course. The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.
