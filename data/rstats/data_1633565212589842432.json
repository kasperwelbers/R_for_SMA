Fortunately, with a bit of R code, you can easily access the latest heating oil prices in New York. The code uses the {dplyr} package to clean and manipulate the data, as well as the {timetk} package to plot the time series. Here’s a breakdown of what the code does: First, it loads the necessary packages and sets the URL for the data source. Next, it reads the HTML from the URL using the read_html function from the xml2 package. It then uses the html_node function from the rvest package to extract the HTML node that contains the data table. The resulting data table is then cleaned and transformed using dplyr functions such as html_table, as_tibble, set_names, select, mutate, and arrange. Finally, the resulting time series data is plotted using plot_time_series from the timetk package.

Our aim is to raise awareness of the utility of Open Source tools in R for conducting all aspects of evidence syntheses (systematic reviews/maps, meta-analysis, rapid reviews, scoping reviews, etc.), to build capacity for conducting rigorous evidence syntheses, to support the development of novel tools and frameworks for robust evience synthesis, and to support a community of practice working in evidence synthesis tool development. ESMARConf began in 2021 and is coordinated by the Evidence Synthesis Hackathon.","unwound_url":"https://esmarconf.org/events.html#programme"}],"mentions":{}},"text":"Check out the exciting #ESMARConf2023 programme - full of amazing workshops, tutorials, and presentations and panel discussions! \n\nRegister and join us for FREE on 27-31 March!\n\n#EvidenceSynthesis #MetaAnalysis #RStats \n\nhttps://t.co/dLhEBQQm49","author_id":"999441958593478656","possibly_sensitive":false,"conversation_id":"1633769599635189763","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":7,"reply_count":0,"like_count":4,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":802},"lang":"en","created_at":"2023-03-09T10:00:01.000Z","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"edit_history_tweet_ids":["1633764667259748352"],"id":"1633764667259748352","entities":{"annotations":[{"start":26,"end":31,"probability":0.9384,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"Python"},{"start":81,"end":86,"probability":0.9439,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"Python"},{"start":89,"end":95,"probability":0.7597,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"python3"},{"start":98,"end":111,"probability":0.5031,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"pythonlearning"},{"start":114,"end":117,"probability":0.5846,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"NFTs"},{"start":120,"end":125,"probability":0.5916,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"Crypto"},{"start":145,"end":149,"probability":0.4898,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"forex"},{"start":177,"end":183,"probability":0.928,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"Bitcoin"},{"start":192,"end":194,"probability":0.5153,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"IoT"}],"hashtags":[{"start":62,"end":79,"tag":"AugmentedReality"},{"start":80,"end":87,"tag":"Python"},{"start":88,"end":96,"tag":"python3"},{"start":97,"end":112,"tag":"pythonlearning"},{"start":113,"end":118,"tag":"NFTs"},{"start":119,"end":126,"tag":"Crypto"},{"start":127,"end":134,"tag":"Trader"},{"start":135,"end":143,"tag":"trading"},{"start":144,"end":150,"tag":"forex"},{"start":151,"end":159,"tag":"Applied"},{"start":160,"end":175,"tag":"cryptocurrency"},{"start":176,"end":184,"tag":"Bitcoin"},{"start":185,"end":190,"tag":"Data"},{"start":191,"end":195,"tag":"IoT"},{"start":196,"end":203,"tag":"RStats"},{"start":204,"end":217,"tag":"WomenWhoCode"},{"start":218,"end":229,"tag":"Serverless"},{"start":230,"end":244,"tag":"100DaysofCode"},{"start":245,"end":261,"tag":"100DaysOfMLCode"},{"start":262,"end":268,"tag":"udemy"}],"urls":[{"start":37,"end":60,"url":"https://t.co/8CG416KrgL","expanded_url":"https://www.couponed12.com/2023/03/applied-cryptography-with-python.html","display_url":"couponed12.com/2023/03/applie…","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1633764668752953344/19jDXRrp?format=jpg&name=orig","width":480,"height":270},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1633764668752953344/19jDXRrp?format=jpg&name=150x150","width":150,"height":150}],"status":200,"title":"Applied Cryptography with Python","description":"Applied Cryptography with Python Are you interested in learning how to use cryptography to protect your data?

assignments in plants is based on mutant analyses. T-DNA insertion lines provided an invaluable resource of mutants and enabled systematic reverse genetics-based investigation of the functions of Arabidopsis thaliana genes during the last decades. Results We sequenced the genomes of 14 A. thaliana GABI-Kat T-DNA insertion lines, which eluded flanking sequence tag-based attempts to characterize their insertion loci, with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long reads. Complex T-DNA insertions were resolved and 11 previously unknown T-DNA loci identified, resulting in about 2 T-DNA insertions per line and suggesting that this number was previously underestimated. T-DNA mutagenesis caused fusions of chromosomes along with compensating translocations to keep the gene set complete throughout meiosis. Also, an inverted duplication of 800 kbp was detected. About 10 % of GABI-Kat lines might be affected by chromosomal rearrangements, some of which ","unwound_url":"https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-021-07877-8"},{"start":277,"end":300,"url":"https://t.co/tcL9JU6j2G","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/AndGenomics/status/1633688784251265027/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/tcL9JU6j2G","images":{},"media_key":"3_1633688098553974784"}],"mentions":{}},"text":"Long Read Sequencing of A. thaliana T-DNA lines\nhttps://t.co/BvrvfBbGh0\n\n#Genomics #OpenScience #DataScience #100DaysOfCode #WomenWhoCode #BigData #MachineLearning #serverless #Linux #Python #coding #SciComm #phdchat #Rstats #Bioinformatics #science #research #AcademicChatter https://t.co/tcL9JU6j2G","author_id":"1038314975968866304","possibly_sensitive":false,"conversation_id":"1633688784251265027","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":12,"reply_count":0,"like_count":20,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":967},"lang":"en","created_at":"2023-03-09T04:38:53.000Z","attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1633688098553974784"],"poll_ids":{}},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"edit_history_tweet_ids":["1633685120371642375"],"id":"1633685120371642375","entities":{"annotations":[{"start":18,"end":22,"probability":0.8101,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"Kenya"}],"hashtags":[{"start":43,"end":51,"tag":"gischat"},{"start":52,"end":59,"tag":"rstats"},{"start":60,"end":71,"tag":"geospatial"}],"urls":[{"start":72,"end":95,"url":"https://t.co/qvwfZDgu1U","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/Godwin_Murithi/status/1633685120371642375/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/qvwfZDgu1U","media_key":"3_1633685109067902976"}],"mentions":{}},"text":"The Topography of Kenya\n©Mappdoutofficial\n\n#gischat #rstats #geospatial https://t.co/qvwfZDgu1U","author_id":"964974181493428224","possibly_sensitive":false,"conversation_id":"1633685120371642375","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":22,"reply_count":1,"like_count":77,"quote_count":1,"impression_count":4425},"lang":"en","created_at":"2023-03-09T04:24:19.000Z","attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1633685109067902976"],"poll_ids":{}},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"edit_history_tweet_ids":["1633683544378671105"],"id":"1633683544378671105","entities":{"annotations":[{"start":31,"end":37,"probability":0.605,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"BigData"},{"start":64,"end":66,"probability":0.5414,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"IoT"},{"start":69,"end":72,"probability":0.5487,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"IIoT"},{"start":75,"end":80,"probability":0.9227,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"Python"},{"start":83,"end":88,"probability":0.5432,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"RStats"},{"start":91,"end":100,"probability":0.7012,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"TensorFlow"},{"start":103,"end":106,"probability":0.811,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"Java"},{"start":109,"end":118,"probability":0.903,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"JavaScript"},{"start":121,"end":127,"probability":0.5495,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"ReactJS"},{"start":130,"end":135,"probability":0.6224,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"GoLang"},{"start":138,"end":151,"probability":0.5218,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"CloudComputing"},{"start":181,"end":185,"probability":0.9438,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"Linux"}],"hashtags":[{"start":30,"end":38,"tag":"BigData"},{"start":39,"end":49,"tag":"Analytics"},{"start":50,"end":62,"tag":"DataScience"},{"start":63,"end":67,"tag":"IoT"},{"start":68,"end":73,"tag":"IIoT"},{"start":74,"end":81,"tag":"Python"},{"start":82,"end":89,"tag":"RStats"},{"start":90,"end":101,"tag":"TensorFlow"},{"start":102,"end":107,"tag":"Java"},{"start":108,"end":119,"tag":"JavaScript"},{"start":120,"end":128,"tag":"ReactJS"},{"start":129,"end":136,"tag":"GoLang"},{"start":137,"end":152,"tag":"CloudComputing"},{"start":153,"end":164,"tag":"Serverless"},{"start":165,"end":179,"tag":"DataScientist"},{"start":180,"end":186,"tag":"Linux"},{"start":187,"end":193,"tag":"Books"},{"start":194,"end":206,"tag":"Programming"},{"start":207,"end":214,"tag":"Coding"},{"start":215,"end":229,"tag":"100DaysofCode"}],"urls":[{"start":231,"end":254,"url":"https://t.co/BsClMSQmoy","expanded_url":"https://geni.us/10-Books-Coder","display_url":"geni.us/10-Books-Coder","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1633683551433502720/GNUPwFWx?format=png&name=orig","width":200,"height":200},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1633683551433502720/GNUPwFWx?format=png&name=150x150","width":150,"height":150}],"status":200,"title":"10 Programming Books That Every Programmer Must Read (2023)","description":"A Computer Science portal for geeks.
