In particular we show that the person starting the game has a very high chance of winning the game. Furthermore, a robust strategy to play during the game is to keep throwing the dice regardless of the number of free pits. In a mixed strategy landscape with more than two players this seems to do better than a strategy extrapolated from the analytically derived optimal strategy for the two player case.

It consists of a container where the lid has 5 pits (labelled 1-5) and one hole (labelled 6). Furthermore, each player gets a predetermined number of sticks and a dice (see Fig.1).

One of the things that came up was to populate DynamoDB tables with data from R. Of course, we didn’t have to do this from R, but most of our data analysis and reporting stack is based on R, so why not keep it all in the same environment. We were surprised, however, that there are very limited resources on how to put data into DynamoDB from R. A quick Google search with these keywords did not reveal any tutorials or blogposts, which are usually plentiful for many other topics in the excellent R community. To our knowledge so far, there are two R packages designed to interact with {DynamoDB}. One is the {aws.dynamodb} package by cloudyr that is no longer maintained. The other option is of course, {paws} – a comprehensive R SDK for AWS, which provides access to over 150 AWS services through R. {paws}’ documentation is extensive, including its coverage of the features of DynamoDB endpoints.

The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.

to invoke an AWS Lambda function with R and paws | R-bloggers","description":"In recent weeks, I have been trying to learn more about using the {paws} software development kit to interact with Amazon Web Services from R. So far, my focus was on the basics of DynamoDB. How to put one item in the database, and how to migrate reasonably sized table into DynamoDB. There are more topics on DynamoDB that I would focus on, and I hope to document my experience in future posts. But today, I wanted to switch gears to AWS Lambda. Specifically, how to invoke an already deployed cloud function from R. AWS Setup In my R+AWS projects I typically include an .Renviron file that stores the needed settings and secrets for authenticating with AWS. These environmental variables are passed as config when starting services with paws.

Let’s say you’ve done this. Kept the EC2 for some time and then decided to terminate it, since after all, even stopped, it still incurs some costs. Then, some time after that, you need to spin up a new instance, and have to go through all of the manual clicking through the AWS console described before. Enter terraform. It is a tool to write infrastructure as code, or more descriptively, as human readable instructions to define resources that can be run on any cloud provider. And since these instructions live in text files, you can have them versioned with git, and keep track of any changes over time. I think this is awesome. Additionally, terraform works with all major cloud providers, so if you prefer to use something else insted of aws you can adapt the code.

The code can be deployed as a zip archive or a container image. In the R case, only the container option is available and enabled by the {lambdr} package (see also this workflow). The deployment using {lambdr}procedure involves: writing an R script to serve as the runtime function creating a Lambda Dockerfile and docker image locally pushing the docker image to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) creating a Lambda function using the ECR image either with the AWS command-line interface (cli) or in the web console Going through this procedure is a rewarding experience, as it teaches many things related to docker containers, AWS setup, using the AWS cli, etc. But, once you have gone through the this procedure a few times, it becomes a bit cumbersome and time-consuming to navigate ","unwound_url":"https://www.r-bloggers.com/2023/02/deploy-an-r-script-as-an-aws-lambda-function-without-leaving-the-r-console/"}],"annotations":[{"start":25,"end":27,"probability":0.5488,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"AWS"},{"start":29,"end":34,"probability":0.4012,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"Lambda"}],"hashtags":[{"start":102,"end":109,"tag":"rstats"},{"start":110,"end":122,"tag":"DataScience"}],"mentions":{}},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":5,"reply_count":0,"like_count":15,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":5044},"lang":"en","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1634814070007136257"],"created_at":"2023-03-12T07:10:22.000Z","conversation_id":"1634814070007136257","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"author_id":"144592995","possibly_sensitive":false,"text":"Deploy an R script as an AWS Lambda function without leaving the R console  {https://t.co/WOXHl8J0c9} #rstats #DataScience","id":"1634814070007136257","referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"entities":{"urls":[{"start":76,"end":99,"url":"https://t.co/ZAvXhg2WXV","expanded_url":"https://www.r-bloggers.com/?p=339634","display_url":"r-bloggers.com/?p=339634","status":200,"title":"Using {stevedore} to manage docker-based variant-calling pipelines from R | R-bloggers","description":"Docker-based variant-calling pipelines Encapsulating large and complex software applications or packages in docker images makes sense for many reasons. Not least because of a one-line install protocol (i.e., docker pull) that takes care of the plethora of dependencies that many of these packages have. This is especially true in bioinformatics, where a differential gene expression workflow or a variant-calling pipeline commonly have several dependencies written in different languages and require installation of each before the final program can be installed. Two of the most widely used software packages for calling genomic variants, gatk and deepVariant, encourage the use of docker images for installation and analysis. Building a variant calling pipeline using one of these tools at some point would require running the respective docker image from the command-line or calling docker by sending a system command to the shell from our programming environment.
