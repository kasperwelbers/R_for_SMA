One tool that many traders use to stay on top of market movements is Finviz, a popular financial visualization website that offers a range of powerful tools and data visualizations to help traders make informed investment decisions. While Finviz is a valuable resource for traders, manually collecting and analyzing data from the website can be time-consuming and inefficient. But this is a data science blog, right? Let’s build a scraper to make our life easier! With this simple function I’m about to show, you will be able to extract the data from the website and analyze it in a streamlined way.

We have also shown that these curves can be modified to include the effects of external/internal factors/covariates, such as the genotype, the species, the humidity content and temperature in the substrate (see here and here). These modified time-to-event curves can be fitted in ‘one-step’, i.e., we start from the germination data with the appropriate shape (see here), fit the model and retrieve the estimates of model parameters ( go to here for an example ). In some cases, we may be interested in following a different approach, that is accomplished in two-steps. Let’s consider an example where we have performed germination assays at 10 different temperatures: instead of building a time-to-event model that contains the temperature as an external covariate, we could: independently fit a different time-to-event curve to the germination data at each

We have also shown that these curves can be modified to include the effects of external/internal factors/covariates, such as the genotype, the species, the humidity content and temperature in the substrate (see here and here). These modified time-to-event curves can be fitted in ‘one-step’, i.e., we start from the germination data with the appropriate shape (see here), fit the model and retrieve the estimates of model parameters ( go to here for an example ). In some cases, we may be interested in following a different approach, that is accomplished in two-steps. Let’s consider an example where we have performed germination assays at 10 different temperatures: instead of building a time-to-event model that contains the temperature as an external covariate, we could: independently fit a different time-to-event curve to the germination data at each

latest stock market news and trends. One tool that many traders use to stay on top of market movements is Finviz, a popular financial visualization website that offers a range of powerful tools and data visualizations to help traders make informed investment decisions. While Finviz is a valuable resource for traders, manually collecting and analyzing data from the website can be time-consuming and inefficient. But this is a data science blog, right? Let’s build a scraper to make our life easier! With this simple function I’m about to show, you will be able to extract the data from the website and analyze it in a streamlined way. Disclaimer Before diving into the topic, it’s important to note that web scraping can potentially violate website terms of service and can even be illegal in some cases. Let’s be polite and don’t use this code to resell any information, as this is","unwound_url":"https://www.r-bloggers.com/2023/03/scrapping-financial-data-from-finviz-with-r-and-rvest-package/"}]},"created_at":"2023-03-14T21:45:25.000Z","author_id":"144592995","conversation_id":"1635759061693071360","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":8,"reply_count":0,"like_count":35,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":7379},"possibly_sensitive":false,"attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"text":"The US 6M (6-month) is also useful in comparison with other several-year rates, here the US 5Y vs 6M #inverted #yield #curves... p.s. if folks wonder how to analyse these data, this is just #base #RStats https://t.co/iXkXM5qgQw https://t.co/0ESAv7ofQV","id":"1635757345283411968","lang":"en","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1635757345283411968"],"entities":{"hashtags":[{"start":101,"end":110,"tag":"inverted"},{"start":111,"end":117,"tag":"yield"},{"start":118,"end":125,"tag":"curves"},{"start":190,"end":195,"tag":"base"},{"start":196,"end":203,"tag":"RStats"}],"mentions":{},"annotations":[{"start":4,"end":5,"probability":0.8442,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"US"},{"start":89,"end":90,"probability":0.8713,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"US"},{"start":197,"end":202,"probability":0.3894,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"RStats"}],"urls":[{"start":204,"end":227,"url":"https://t.co/iXkXM5qgQw","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/LeppinkAnalyti1/status/1635757345283411968/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/iXkXM5qgQw","media_key":"3_1635756771477184512"},{"start":228,"end":251,"url":"https://t.co/0ESAv7ofQV","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/LeppinkAnalyti1/status/1635756310502187009","display_url":"twitter.com/LeppinkAnalyti…"}]},"created_at":"2023-03-14T21:38:36.000Z","author_id":"1545765777483112448","conversation_id":"1635757345283411968","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":1,"impression_count":123},"possibly_sensitive":false,"attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1635756771477184512"],"poll_ids":{}},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"quoted","id":"1635756310502187009"}],"geo":{}},{"text":"Databricks R users #rstats, how do you parallelize things?  future_map functions are not behaving for me when I am running queries in the workers?","id":"1635755823157878784","lang":"en","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1635755823157878784"],"entities":{"hashtags":[{"start":19,"end":26,"tag":"rstats"}],"mentions":{},"annotations":[{"start":20,"end":25,"probability":0.4813,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"rstats"},{"start":60,"end":69,"probability":0.5602,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"future_map"}],"urls":{}},"created_at":"2023-03-14T21:32:33.000Z","author_id":"902634516224720896","conversation_id":"1635755823157878784","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":1,"reply_count":1,"like_count":2,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":675},"possibly_sensitive":false,"attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"text":"Manipulating Time Series Data with xts and zoo in R.

The posterior updates the amount of mass on this point, leading to a posterior distribution that is actually sparse, in the sense that if you sample from it many coefficients are actually zeros. Sampling from this posterior distribution is an elegant way to handle Bayesian variable selection and model averaging.

and model it. In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data.","unwound_url":"https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html"},{"start":275,"end":298,"url":"https://t.co/nOQ31Xjhmx","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/CedScherer/status/1635611505902116865/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/nOQ31Xjhmx","images":{},"media_key":"3_1635604337031364608"},{"start":275,"end":298,"url":"https://t.co/nOQ31Xjhmx","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/CedScherer/status/1635611505902116865/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/nOQ31Xjhmx","images":{},"media_key":"3_1635602935244521472"},{"start":275,"end":298,"url":"https://t.co/nOQ31Xjhmx","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/CedScherer/status/1635611505902116865/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/nOQ31Xjhmx","images":{},"media_key":"3_1635602588727930883"},{"start":275,"end":298,"url":"https://t.co/nOQ31Xjhmx","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/CedScherer/status/1635611505902116865/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/nOQ31Xjhmx","images":{},"media_key":"3_1635602330878877696"}]},"created_at":"2023-03-14T11:59:05.000Z","author_id":"3092381638","conversation_id":"1635611505902116865","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":46,"reply_count":6,"like_count":307,"quote_count":3,"impression_count":42607},"possibly_sensitive":false,"attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1635604337031364608","3_1635602935244521472","3_1635602588727930883","3_1635602330878877696"],"poll_ids":{}},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"text":"Dear

This workshop deals with the analysis and modelling of population dynamics. In this introductory workshop, we will cover population projection matrix models, the estimation of demographic parameters (e.g. survival, dispersal) using capture-recapture models and the estimation of population density and abundance using capture-recapture, N-mixture and distance sampling models. The format of the workshop will be a combination of lectures and practical sessions in R with packages popbio, RMark and unmarked. The workshop is online, free of charge, and will be video recorded. Olivier Gimenez, Sarah Cubaynes, Aurélien Besnard.","unwound_url":"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2SyOxuMIlZ1vWQgqcMqRfA2RLh7PJKHdDsltTts_DCWD2DQ/viewform?usp=send_form","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1635580787729879040/BmZIPQqa?format=jpg&name=orig","width":1200,"height":630},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1635580787729879040/BmZIPQqa?format=jpg&name=150x150","width":150,"height":150}]}]},"created_at":"2023-03-14T09:56:51.000Z","author_id":"1131101567367680005","conversation_id":"1635580730951565312","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":1,"like_count":2,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":221},"possibly_sensitive":false,"attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1635580740527177728"}],"in_reply_to_user_id":"1131101567367680005","geo":{}},{"text":"How to draw multiple lines to the same ggplot2 plot in the R programming language: https://t.co/AYJqejwp97\n\n#datavis #programmer #rstudioglobal #VisualAnalytics #tidyverse #RStats #datasciencetraining","id":"1635576544746774529","lang":"en","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1635576544746774529"],"entities":{"hashtags":[{"start":108,"end":116,"tag":"datavis"},{"start":117,"end":128,"tag":"programmer"},{"start":129,"end":143,"tag":"rstudioglobal"},{"start":144,"end":160,"tag":"VisualAnalytics"},{"start":161,"end":171,"tag":"tidyverse"},{"start":172,"end":179,"tag":"RStats"},{"start":180,"end":200,"tag":"datasciencetraining"}],"mentions":{},"annotations":[{"start":39,"end":45,"probability":0.7462,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"ggplot2"},{"start":130,"end":142,"probability":0.6532,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"rstudioglobal"},{"start":162,"end":170,"probability":0.5165,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"tidyverse"},{"start":173,"end":178,"probability":0.4257,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"RStats"}],"urls":[{"start":83,"end":106,"url":"https://t.co/AYJqejwp97","expanded_url":"https://statisticsglobe.com/r-draw-multiple-lines-to-same-ggplot2-plot","display_url":"statisticsglobe.com/r-draw-multipl…","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1635576601449582593/LnOeHFMh?format=jpg&name=orig","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1635576601449582593/LnOeHFMh?format=jpg&name=150x150","width":150,"height":150}],"status":200,"title":"Draw Multiple Variables as Lines to Same ggplot2 Plot in R (2 Examples)","description":"How to plot a ggplot2 graph showing multiple columns as lines in R - 2 R programming examples & actionable instructions","unwound_url":"https://statisticsglobe.com/r-draw-multiple-lines-to-same-ggplot2-plot"}]},"created_at":"2023-03-14T09:40:10.000Z","author_id":"1026075110569070593","conversation_id":"1635576544746774529","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":12,"reply_count":0,"like_count":21,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":2815},"possibly_sensitive":false,"attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"text":"DataMotto (@DataMotto) is an AI assisted notebook that lets you code in #rstats, #Python &amp; #Julia (even all on the same page) &amp; has an AI assistant to help write your code.

In particular we show that the person starting the game has a very high chance of winning the game. Furthermore, a robust strategy to play during the game is to keep throwing the dice regardless of the number of free pits. In a mixed strategy landscape with more than two players this seems to do better than a strategy extrapolated from the analytically derived optimal strategy for the two player case.

It consists of a container where the lid has 5 pits (labelled 1-5) and one hole (labelled 6). Furthermore, each player gets a predetermined number of sticks and a dice (see Fig.1). If a stick is put into pit 6 (the hole) it falls into","unwound_url":"https://www.r-bloggers.com/2023/03/how-to-win-a-game-or-more-of-super-six/"}]},"created_at":"2023-03-13T20:33:18.000Z","author_id":"287836809","conversation_id":"1635378522226032645","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":14},"possibly_sensitive":false,"attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"text":"IBA cocktails in csv and json format: But why?!! via #rbloggers #rstats #datascience https://t.co/WlHLoPVFUV","id":"1635378518480629763","lang":"en","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1635378518480629763"],"entities":{"hashtags":[{"start":53,"end":63,"tag":"rbloggers"},{"start":64,"end":71,"tag":"rstats"},{"start":72,"end":84,"tag":"datascience"}],"mentions":{},"annotations":[{"start":0,"end":2,"probability":0.3704,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"IBA"},{"start":17,"end":19,"probability":0.346,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"csv"},{"start":25,"end":28,"probability":0.3971,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"json"},{"start":65,"end":70,"probability":0.5883,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"rstats"}],"urls":[{"start":85,"end":108,"url":"https://t.co/WlHLoPVFUV","expanded_url":"https://bit.ly/3YE3FVC","display_url":"bit.ly/3YE3FVC","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1635136219863711745/BGGLLwK5?format=jpg&name=orig","width":1160,"height":731},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1635136219863711745/BGGLLwK5?format=jpg&name=150x150","width":150,"height":150}],"status":200,"title":"IBA cocktails in csv and json format: But why?!! | R-bloggers","description":"Yesterday I put up a post where I described how I scraped The International Bartenders Association (IBA) cocktails into csv and json format.
