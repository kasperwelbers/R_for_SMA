The viewer widget can be either standalone or embedded into 'R-shiny' applications. The standalone version only require a web browser with 'WebGL2' support (for example, 'Chrome', 'Firefox', 'Safari'), and can be inserted into any websites. The 'R-shiny' support allows the 3D viewer to be dynamically generated from reactive user inputs. This feature has been fully adopted by 'RAVE' <https://openwetware.org/wiki/RAVE>, an interactive toolbox to analyze 'iEEG' data. Documentation about 'threeBrain' is provided by <https://dipterix.org/threeBrain/> and several vignettes included in this package.

(generated is really too strong a word) and what very often happens is that these handcrafted tables have typos. Usually it’s totals that are wrong. Checking the totals in these tables by hand with a pocket calculator is a tedious, long and boring job. So as my job’s statistician but also kinda automation dude that types all day in a weird black box, I’ve been asked if it were possible to automate these checks on tables in a Word document. And of course, the answer is yes, because whatever you need to get done, there’s an R package for that! There are, to my knowledge, 2 packages that we can use to get tables from a Word document into R (an activity that I will now refer to as office-scraping). These packages are {officer} and {docxtractr}. For his particular task I’ve used {docxtractr}. The reason is that {docxtractr} returns the table “as-is”, while {officer} returns a","unwound_url":"https://www.r-bloggers.com/2023/03/automating-checks-of-handcrafted-word-tables-with-docxtractr/"}],"annotations":[{"start":53,"end":62,"probability":0.5209,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"docxtractr"},{"start":93,"end":98,"probability":0.3814,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"rstats"}],"mentions":{}},"lang":"en","author_id":"144592995","conversation_id":"1637193489044631555","possibly_sensitive":false,"attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"edit_history_tweet_ids":["1637189091996360711"],"text":"The latest The Data science Daily from Data Geek (@SQLMaster) ! https://t.co/t5NLVIoyML Thanks to @gdprAI @rstats4ds #rstats #datascience","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":1,"reply_count":0,"like_count":1,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":575},"created_at":"2023-03-18T20:27:51.000Z","id":"1637189091996360711","entities":{"hashtags":[{"start":117,"end":124,"tag":"rstats"},{"start":125,"end":137,"tag":"datascience"}],"urls":[{"start":64,"end":87,"url":"https://t.co/t5NLVIoyML","expanded_url":"https://paper.li/SQLMaster/1547324714?share_id=5b0faba0-c5cb-11ed-890c-fa163ed80008","display_url":"paper.li/SQLMaster/1547…","status":200,"title":"Paper.li","description":"Paper.li - The service has been sunset on 20 April 2023","unwound_url":"https://goodbye.paper.li/"}],"annotations":[{"start":11,"end":32,"probability":0.7145,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"The Data science Daily"},{"start":39,"end":47,"probability":0.8714,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"Data Geek"}],"mentions":[{"start":50,"end":60,"username":"SqlMaster","id":"1594163528755200000"},{"start":98,"end":105,"username":"gdprAI","id":"1150696280110313472"},{"start":106,"end":116,"username":"rstats4ds","id":"1075011651366199297"}]},"lang":"en","author_id":"42371035","conversation_id":"1637189091996360711","possibly_sensitive":false,"attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"edit_history_tweet_ids":["1637185569032740866"],"text":"Growth curve for exclusive breastfeeding vs non-exclusive breastfeeding. #rstat #RStats #dataviz https://t.co/bBlxJKSx0T","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":40},"created_at":"2023-03-18T20:13:51.000Z","id":"1637185569032740866","entities":{"hashtags":[{"start":73,"end":79,"tag":"rstat"},{"start":80,"end":87,"tag":"RStats"},{"start":88,"end":96,"tag":"dataviz"}],"urls":[{"start":97,"end":120,"url":"https://t.co/bBlxJKSx0T","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/uc_ezema/status/1637185569032740866/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/bBlxJKSx0T","media_key":"3_1637185485654179842"}],"annotations":[{"start":74,"end":78,"probability":0.6151,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"rstat"},{"start":81,"end":86,"probability":0.7142,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"RStats"}],"mentions":{}},"lang":"en","author_id":"1632163553569284096","conversation_id":"1637185569032740866","possibly_sensitive":false,"attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1637185485654179842"],"poll_ids":{}},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"edit_history_tweet_ids":["1637184849349083136"],"text":"Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python &amp;
