More than that, the highest-grossing movie of the year (which is, somehow, Avatar: The Way of Water) and the second-highest grossing (Top Gun: Maverick) were both nominated.

The quality of groundwater used for public supply was assessed in 25 principal aquifers (PAs) that account for 84% of groundwater pumped for public supply in the U.S. (89.6 million people on a proportional basis). Each PA was sampled across its lateral extent using an equal-area grid, typically with 60 wells per PA. Samples were analyzed for 502 constituents, of which 374 had either a regulatory or nonregulatory human health benchmark (HHB). Nationally, elevated concentrations (relative to HHBs) of geogenic constituents have a larger effect than anthropogenic constituents, as indicated by three metrics: detection frequency, 35% versus 8.1%; prevalence (based on area), 41% versus 6.4%; and population potentially affected, 31.2 million versus 7.1 million.

Secondly, I’m going to fix up my final figure, which is the one I shared on social media: My first try at a #TidyTuesday challenge. We were given a dataset about what characters are used to comment computer code. This viz shows the most “highly ranked” language for each type of commenting token.

ultimate guide to ordering rows in R | R-bloggers","description":"Intro Setup base R ‘data․table’ dplyr pandas Wrap-up Intro Sorting rows in a data.frame is generally considered a straightforward task, which it mostly is - until it isn’t. It seems that the operation of ordering rows doesn’t get much attention in introductory books on data science. Both R for Data Science and Python for Data Analysis only touch the subject very briefly. So this post comes to the rescue. Below we look at several ordering operations and examine how the three big paradigms in R, base R, ‘data.table’ and ‘dplyr’, compare in tackling different ordering operations. We will look at seven challenges loosely ordered by their increasing complexity. We are going to order rows according to … … one or several columns in ascending or descending order. … a character vector with matching names. … a simple expression. … a complex expression. … all columns in a data.frame. … a vector of column names. … a vector of matching patterns.

This blog post showcases the three main features of {hugodownplus}: a table of content, an expandable session info box, and wrapping text or code in expandable HTML boxes. Although the main features are already explained in the official documentation, the big advantage of this blog post is that we can actually showcase each feature, which is neither possible in a GitHub README nor within a {pkgdown} website. Before diving into the details, I’ll briefly elaborate on where the idea and inspiration for this package came from.
