Some were sensible, like rationalizing bus stops along EDSA. Some were, uh, destined to be hallmarks of the time. One of the more forward-thinking was the elevation of bicycles as a bona fide mode of transport. What’s not to love: they take little road space, they’re cheap, they’re green, and they keep you fit.1 Biking infrastructure is an actionable investment while waiting for the big-ticket rail projects to crawl towards completion. Funding for the construction of bike lanes in Metro Manila, Metro Cebu, and Metro Davao was included in the pandemic recovery bill. The transportation and public works departments, tasked with implementation, received technical assistance from the World Bank and the Netherlands Embassy to ensure a “Safe System approach” and “Dutch Cycling Infrastructure principles”. Contracts were drawn up and opened to the private sector for bidding.

However, we do not know how analysts conceptualize grammar abstractions, or how a visualization grammar works with data analysis in practice. Therefore, we qualitatively analyzed how experienced analysts (N=6) from TidyTuesday, a social data project, wrangled and visualized data using GoG-based ggplot2 without given tasks in R Markdown. Though participants' analysis and customization needs could mismatch with GoG component design, their analysis processes aligned with the goal of GoG to expedite visualization iteration. We also found a feedback loop and tight coupling between visualization and data transformation code, explaining both participants' productivity and their errors.

Computation and Visualisation of Atmospheric Convective Parameters","description":"Allow to compute and visualise convective parameters commonly used in the operational prediction of severe convective storms. Core algorithm is based on a highly optimized 'C++' code linked into 'R' via 'Rcpp'. Highly efficient engine allows to derive thermodynamic and kinematic parameters from large numerical datasets such as reanalyses or operational Numerical Weather Prediction models in a reasonable amount of time. Package has been developed since 2017 by research meteorologists specializing in severe thunderstorms. The most relevant methods used in the package based on the following publications Stipanuk (1973) <https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD0769739.pdf>, McCann et al.
