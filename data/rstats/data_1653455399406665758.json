Reinforcement Learning Based Trajectory Planning Under Uncertain Constraints","description":"With the advance in algorithms, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offers solutions to trajectory planning under uncertain environments. Different from traditional trajectory planning which requires lots of effort to tackle complicated high-dimensional problems, the recently proposed DRL enables the robot manipulator to autonomously learn and discover optimal trajectory planning by interacting with the environment. In this article, we present state-of-the-art DRL-based collision-avoidance trajectory planning for uncertain environments such as a safe human coexistent environment. Since the robot manipulator operates in high dimensional continuous state-action spaces, model-free, policy gradient-based soft actor-critic (SAC), and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) framework are adapted to our scenario for comparison. In order to assess our proposal, we simulate a 7-DOF Panda (Franka Emika) robot manipulator in the PyBullet physics engine and then evaluate its trajectory planning wi","unwound_url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbot.2022.883562/full"},{"start":278,"end":301,"url":"https://t.co/6KHM3AHAjV","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/gp_pulipaka/status/1653616888046395392/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/6KHM3AHAjV","images":{},"media_key":"3_1653616877535412224"},{"start":278,"end":301,"url":"https://t.co/6KHM3AHAjV","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/gp_pulipaka/status/1653616888046395392/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/6KHM3AHAjV","images":{},"media_key":"3_1653616880202940417"},{"start":278,"end":301,"url":"https://t.co/6KHM3AHAjV","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/gp_pulipaka/status/1653616888046395392/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/6KHM3AHAjV","images":{},"media_key":"3_1653616882597912577"},{"start":278,"end":301,"url":"https://t.co/6KHM3AHAjV","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/gp_pulipaka/status/1653616888046395392/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/6KHM3AHAjV","images":{},"media_key":"3_1653616885525540864"}],"annotations":[{"start":30,"end":36,"probability":0.5691,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"BigData"},{"start":63,"end":64,"probability":0.459,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"AI"},{"start":84,"end":86,"probability":0.5537,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"IoT"},{"start":89,"end":92,"probability":0.4851,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"IIoT"},{"start":95,"end":101,"probability":0.588,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"PyTorch"},{"start":104,"end":109,"probability":0.9221,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"Python"},{"start":112,"end":117,"probability":0.453,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"RStats"},{"start":120,"end":129,"probability":0.6776,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"TensorFlow"},{"start":132,"end":135,"probability":0.8191,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"Java"},{"start":138,"end":147,"probability":0.8939,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"JavaScript"},{"start":150,"end":156,"probability":0.5358,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"ReactJS"},{"start":159,"end":164,"probability":0.5811,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"GoLang"},{"start":210,"end":214,"probability":0.9305,"type":"Other","normalized_text":"Linux"}],"mentions":{}},"author_id":"4263007693","edit_history_tweet_ids":["1653616888046395392"],"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":9,"reply_count":0,"like_count":8,"quote_count":0,"impression_count":1173},"text":"Deep #ReinforcementLearning. #BigData #Analytics #DataScience #AI #MachineLearning #IoT #IIoT #PyTorch #Python #RStats #TensorFlow #Java #JavaScript #ReactJS #GoLang #CloudComputing #Serverless #DataScientist #Linux #Programming #Coding #100DaysofCode  \nhttps://t.co/09af3TXzHX https://t.co/6KHM3AHAjV","lang":"en","possibly_sensitive":false,"id":"1653616888046395392","conversation_id":"1653616888046395392","attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1653616877535412224","3_1653616880202940417","3_1653616882597912577","3_1653616885525540864"],"poll_ids":{}},"referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"created_at":"2023-05-03T04:26:01.000Z","entities":{"hashtags":[{"start":42,"end":50,"tag":"BigData"},{"start":51,"end":61,"tag":"Analytics"},{"start":62,"end":74,"tag":"DataScience"},{"start":75,"end":78,"tag":"AI"},{"start":79,"end":95,"tag":"MachineLearning"},{"start":96,"end":100,"tag":"IoT"},{"start":101,"end":106,"tag":"IIoT"},{"start":107,"end":114,"tag":"Python"},{"start":115,"end":122,"tag":"RStats"},{"start":123,"end":134,"tag":"TensorFlow"},{"start":135,"end":140,"tag":"Java"},{"start":141,"end":152,"tag":"JavaScript"},{"start":153,"end":161,"tag":"ReactJS"},{"start":162,"end":177,"tag":"CloudComputing"},{"start":178,"end":189,"tag":"Serverless"},{"start":190,"end":204,"tag":"DataScientist"},{"start":205,"end":211,"tag":"Linux"},{"start":212,"end":224,"tag":"Programming"},{"start":225,"end":232,"tag":"Coding"},{"start":233,"end":247,"tag":"100DaysofCode"}],"urls":[{"start":250,"end":273,"url":"https://t.co/RVOpcnFDjl","expanded_url":"https://geni.us/KNN-Neighbor","display_url":"geni.us/KNN-Neighbor","images":[{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1653616883793383428/q6GWpIT7?format=jpg&name=orig","width":1000,"height":667},{"url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1653616883793383428/q6GWpIT7?format=jpg&name=150x150","width":150,"height":150}],"status":200,"title":"KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor): Classification","description":"In our last post, we discussed SVMs (Support Mector Machines).
